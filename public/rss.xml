They say you have to win the morning to win the day, and I found that to be true, just in reverse. I lost the morning, and I certainly lost the day.  But otherwise, it was a good week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In fact, I feel like I had a great week in terms of notes. Some highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;attention&quot;&gt;Attention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On HackerNews, the article &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24391686&quot;&gt;Attention is your scarcest resource&lt;/a&gt; made its rounds last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key quote from the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äú50%+ focus‚Äù is roughly when something becomes the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html&quot;&gt;top idea in your mind&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs when you start caring enough to think about it in the shower. It‚Äôs when you start habitually asking ‚Äúhow could this go faster?‚Äù It‚Äôs when you get &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html&quot;&gt;relentlessly resourceful&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs around when you start &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.benkuhn.net/impatient/&quot;&gt;annoying your coworkers and/or significant other&lt;/a&gt;, although that part is avoidable with practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having one top idea in your mind (itself, an essay from Paul Graham) is extremely powerful. Anecdotally, it seems that my teammates&amp;#39; best ideas emerge spontaneously, and outside of work. One day, we&amp;#39;ll show up to work in the morning and they&amp;#39;ll tell me &amp;quot;Hey, had this idea, what if we...&amp;quot;- and suddenly we&amp;#39;re on a new trajectory. Personally, I come up with a lot of my best ideas in the early morning, or after working up a sweat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention is scarce, and we all understand how constant context switching can kill productivity. But there&amp;#39;s another cost to splintering your attention - an opportunity cost of sorts. Our brains run a variety of processes, of which we&amp;#39;re only conscious of &amp;quot;linear thinking&amp;quot;. When it comes to problem solving and searching for creative solutions, our subconscious brain, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/lecture/learning-how-to-learn/introduction-to-the-focused-and-diffuse-modes-75EsZ&quot;&gt;diffuse mode&lt;/a&gt; of thinking, needs to be activated too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t seen any instructions on how to activate this creative, diffuse mode of &amp;quot;connecting the dots&amp;quot; - but I believe that curiosity is necessary. If you only keep deeply &lt;a href=&quot;weekly_notes/2020-07-26#questions&quot;&gt;interesting questions&lt;/a&gt; in your mind, you stand a chance. But, there&amp;#39;s clearly a limit to the number of interesting questions we can load into our brains. 1,000 is too many. But what about 2? Can our diffuse modes consider even 2 simultaneous questions? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not so sure. I believe we must focus on one thing at a time. On any given day - focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-take-smart-notes&quot;&gt;How to Take Smart Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started reading, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;How to Take Smart Notes&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure how I ended up buying it, but it popped up on my radar enough times to warrant a look (likely the #roamcult). When a few smart people start recommending the same thing, that&amp;#39;s a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I&amp;#39;m about halfway through the book and I&amp;#39;m convinced it will change my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s why: this book will change the way you read and learn. When it comes to knowledge, most people are living paycheck to paycheck - we are as smart as the most recent stuff we&amp;#39;ve read. This book presents a system that allows us to create a knowledge bank that can accrue learning AND compound in value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools like Roam and Obsidian facilitate this system. But the tool is insufficient, you must learn the procedure of how to maintain your ever growing web of knowledge. Simply having a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex&quot;&gt;memex&lt;/a&gt; is not enough. How you manage it is everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be summarizing/reviewing this book soon - its lessons are hard to put into practice. But I believe that those who do will reap benefits that are hard to imagine. After all, the human brain isn&amp;#39;t very good at intuiting exponential growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;portability&quot;&gt;Portability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea came up in the context of the term &amp;quot;digital sharecropping&amp;quot; - or the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/skmurphy/status/1304955612384485376?s=20&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;investing in a platform you don&amp;#39;t own&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. It happens in the context of &amp;quot;user generated content&amp;quot;, but also when building a business on top of another platform which might shut down at any moment (i.e. Facebook games, Twitter API). Or the platform might just shut &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; down (i.e. via a cease and desist or &lt;a href=&quot;https://ourincrediblejourney.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Acquihire&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is also interesting as it relates to the careers of software engineers. Compare, as an exercise, a software engineer to a salesperson. The salesperson gains skills at a company, learns a process, but most importantly, builds up a rolodex of people that work at other companies. By doing deals with a lot of different people, they accumulate a network that grows more valuable every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast this to the software engineer. The engineer gains skills, learns processes, but in contrast, builds up a resume of commits that are only visible within the company. Sure, the engineer may develop relationships with people, but there&amp;#39;s a limit to the number of &amp;quot;career changing connections&amp;quot; they make as mere a byproduct of their job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider internal transfers vs external hires. With transfers, we can look at someone&amp;#39;s commits and see their work product. We do half the number of interviews we normally would for an outside hire, and the process is greatly relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, software engineers get paid a good amount (especially early in their careers), but they need to realize that there&amp;#39;s limited liquidity to their skills. Outside of the knowledge you gain and a title bump, there&amp;#39;s very little you can take with you (and even then, the title bump might not be respected by a new employer). You can&amp;#39;t always take your domain expertise. You can&amp;#39;t take your commits (which you can use to reference previous best practices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will you work at the same company forever? If you suspect the answer is no, then you&amp;#39;ll likely need to change some of your habits. Invest in transferable technical skills (focus less time on company specific excellence and more on general excellence). Write on the internet, use social media, do open source - build yourself a bit of a reputation. Invest in portability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;miscellaneous&quot;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;False Dichotomies&lt;/strong&gt; - I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about ways in which the world is not black or white. Not enough here to share an idea, but consider these constructs: &amp;quot;Architect vs Gardener&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Bootstrap or VC&amp;quot;. To me, they&amp;#39;re all false dichotomies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep&lt;/strong&gt; - my sleep this last week has improved üôå. Or at the very least, I&amp;#39;ve used melatonin and orange tinted, blue light blocking glasses to adjust my sleep schedule to about Midnight to ~8AM. Not sure if my sleep has improved, but productivity has seen a small boost!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rewire your Anxious Brain&lt;/strong&gt; - another book that I&amp;#39;m reading that I think has useful applications to my life. I&amp;#39;ve always found truth in the idea that &amp;quot;what we need to do is often what we fear the most&amp;quot; But I&amp;#39;ve never had a good strategy for dealing with it. This book doesn&amp;#39;t solve the psychological, but it does help you understand the neuroscience behind why you can&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;think your way&amp;quot; past anxiety, and you need different tools for this rewiring üß†. Will do a summary/review of it soon-ish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

And there‚Äôs a ton of stuff to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;meme-marketing&quot;&gt;Meme Marketing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic emerged from a conversation with my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChalupaBatmanGG&quot;&gt;David Park&lt;/a&gt;. David‚Äôs company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kippoapp.com/&quot;&gt;Kippo&lt;/a&gt;, is a dating app for gamers. And while there‚Äôs much to talk about regarding the &lt;a href=&quot;/weekly_notes/2020-08-09#internet-friends&quot;&gt;digitization of dating and social interaction&lt;/a&gt;, the company‚Äôs early growth strategy is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1252324468002713600?s=20&quot;&gt;Lenny Rachitsky asked on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer app founders: How did you get your first 2,000 users?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChalupaBatmanGG/status/1252359322329157638?s=20&quot;&gt;David responded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created a meme with a footer to our website. Made it to the front page with 52k upvotes. Free impressions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally got a chance to catch up with David last week and had to ask him about it. Here&amp;#39;s a brief summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(One day, we&amp;#39;ll need to get David to deconstruct this process some more, but for now, you&amp;#39;re stuck with my rendition.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit is the self proclaimed &amp;quot;Front Page of the Internet&amp;quot;. When successfully harnessed, Reddit can send your website a stampede of traffic. That&amp;#39;s great for marketers, but Redditors HATE being marketed to. Perhaps due to unsavory past experiences, the moment they smell a marketer, Redditors attack. The visual I imagine is much like &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/a-game-of-drones-why-some-bees-kill-their-queens-83624&quot;&gt;bees turning on their queen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending far too much time on Reddit, David noticed that Memes outperformed other posts. He started asking: ‚ÄúHow could we make memes work for Kippo?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he didn&amp;#39;t just blindly start making Memes. Instead, he asked a pivotal follow up &lt;a href=&quot;weekly_notes/2020-07-26#questions&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; ‚ÄúWhy is a meme funny on Reddit?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kippo team noticed patterns. Some memes were unexpectedly relatable. Others had shock value. And they got to work producing memes that reconstructed those sensations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some duds, but soon enough the Memes started to catch fire. Here are a couple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EWUPV5mUMA4NuMV?format=png&amp;name=small&quot; alt=&quot;True Love meme&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EWUPX7ZU4AEEKj5?format=jpg&amp;name=medium&quot; alt=&quot;What people think Gaming is like&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kippo doesn‚Äôt rely on Memes as much these days (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kippoapp.com/comics&quot;&gt;Kippo Comics&lt;/a&gt; for their primary meme distribution channel), but I found this 0 to 2,000 users story fascinating. It reminds me of this grab-bag of tactics &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kapwing.com/blog/viral-content/&quot;&gt;used by Kapwing&lt;/a&gt; - which is presumably, the maturation of tactics from Kapwing&amp;#39;s early days of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kapwing.com/blog/how-we-got-our-first-10-customers/&quot;&gt;(successful) floundering&lt;/a&gt;. As well as this tactic used by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.towerpaddleboards.com/&quot;&gt;Tower Paddle Boards&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketingexamples.com/seo/unsplash&quot;&gt;grow via Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unconventional, but very effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;open-source-business-models&quot;&gt;Open Source Business Models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money and open source have a funny relationship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;#39;s clarify that there is no philosophical tension between Open Source and profits. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fsf.org/about/&quot;&gt;Free Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, arguably the spiritual center of Open Source, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html&quot;&gt;this to say&lt;/a&gt; on the topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people believe that the spirit of the GNU Project is that you should not charge money for distributing copies of software, or that you should charge as little as possible‚Äîjust enough to cover the cost. This is a misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, we encourage people who redistribute free software to charge as much as they wish or can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More fundamentally, there seems to be a contradiction in &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to make money with Open Source. How do you charge money for software that is 100% open and free to run? Would that not yield perfect competition, eliminate profits, and turn these into untenable businesses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Red Hat (&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/with-the-acquisition-closed-ibm-goes-all-in-on-red-hat/&quot;&gt;acq. by IBM&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CLDR?p=CLDR&amp;amp;.tsrc=fin-srch&quot;&gt;Cloudera&lt;/a&gt;, MuleSoft (&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/salesforce-is-buying-mulesoft-at-enterprise-value-of-6-5-billion/&quot;&gt;acq. by SalesForce&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MDB?p=MDB&amp;amp;.tsrc=fin-srch&quot;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ESTC?p=ESTC&amp;amp;.tsrc=fin-srch&quot;&gt;Elastic&lt;/a&gt; all beg to differ. These are all multi-billion dollar companies that trade (or traded) on the public markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you look at the IPO pipeline, you might see Confluent, Hashicorp, Databricks and others not too far away from the event horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do these companies charge for? A survey in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2019/10/04/commercializing-open-source/&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of enterprise open source will yield the following story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support (i.e. Red Hat)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proprietary software built upon an open source core - aka Open Core - and sold as an annual license (i.e. most of Elastic&amp;#39;s business)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SaaS offering of the open source code, in partnership with public cloud (i.e., the fastest growing segment of Mongo&amp;#39;s business)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who follow enterprise software, it&amp;#39;s the SaaS angle that has recently unlocked Open Source for these venture backed businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s interesting that all of the examples I cited so far are very much &amp;quot;infrastructure&amp;quot; products. But the trend of Open Source business models has caught on elsewhere too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://mattermost.com/&quot;&gt;Mattermost&lt;/a&gt; (an Open source Slack alternative) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.org/&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; (an alternative to Wordpress). Two examples of how Open Source software is expanding beyond it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;home court&amp;quot; of developers, and capturing a broader spectrum of users. (Ghost, btw, is not only Open Source, but a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.org/about/&quot;&gt;non-profit&lt;/a&gt; too. One that just happens to make $200K+ in MRR)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you look at smaller products (yet admittedly, more targeted at developers), you might find &lt;a href=&quot;https://tailwindui.com/&quot;&gt;TailwindUI&lt;/a&gt;, which is built atop the Open Source project &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss&quot;&gt;TailwindCSS&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://forge.laravel.com/&quot;&gt;Laravel Forge&lt;/a&gt;, which is similarly built atop the Open Source project &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/laravel/laravel&quot;&gt;Laravel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without considering all these examples, you might have believed that there is no business model in open source. That the only way to get funds doing Open Source is getting backed by a corporate patron (ie React), or decentralized patronage (ie Vue). And for many (most?) open source maintainers, survival is indeed about finding patrons. (Choose one of: 1) GitHub sponsors/Open Collective, 2) work for Google/Facebook on Open Source, or 3) burnout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s simply not the full story. Too many developers get into the &amp;quot;business&amp;quot; of Open Source without ever realizing that they&amp;#39;re sitting atop a potential goldmine (in the form of a community and audience). Open Source maintainers are often influencers by accident. The challenge is monetizing this influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Source businesses are going to become increasingly important moving forward (especially for developer focused products). Open Source builds trust, transforms the community into &amp;quot;co-creators&amp;quot; (superfans), generates another distribution channel, establishes goodwill. A well run open source company has natural advantages that its closed source counterparts simply do not have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say Open Source business is easy. Simply that it is the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll be writing about this topic a lot, but just giving you a first glance into my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;miscellaneous&quot;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m introducing a new section to these weekly notes, where I write bullet points about random things that I came across this week. If the above are half baked notes, the following are uncooked. Here we go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First thoughts on Rust-lang. Coming from Golang and Java, the idea of eliminating concurrency issues like race conditions &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html#mutable-references&quot;&gt;by design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is amazing. Sadly, I also miss Golang&amp;#39;s compilation speeds. Go compiles fast &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/2976675&quot;&gt;by design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finally watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11394168/&quot;&gt;Be Water&lt;/a&gt; - the documentary on Bruce Lee. His unyielding refusal to take on any demeaning role, paired with a  mentality of &amp;quot;your loss&amp;quot; towards those who didn&amp;#39;t value his vision - is a model of self-respect. We lost Bruce when he was 32 and right on the cusp of superstardom. Far too early. And in a huge blow to Asian American masculinity, Hollywood picked Jackie Chan as his successor. I love Jackie, but -  let me just say this, Jackie worked in the house, and Bruce in the field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Datadog is an amazing company - or at least &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; think it is, after looking at their 10K. Sales and Marketing efficiency is best in class. Their strategy is amazing too (unified metrics, tracing, and logs &lt;em&gt;chefs kiss&lt;/em&gt;). So much to learn and unpack about this company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next time you&amp;#39;re scared and want to &amp;quot;bury your head in the sand&amp;quot;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://animals.howstuffworks.com/birds/do-ostriches-really-bury-heads-in-sand.htm&quot;&gt;consider the facts&lt;/a&gt;. Ostriches do not actually bury their heads when scared. Rather, they bury their eggs in the sand, and rotate their eggs multiple times a day. They are not scared, they&amp;#39;re just taking care of their young. I mean, just think about it, why would a 9 ft, 350 lb animal be scared? Not to mention they&amp;#39;re fast (40 MPH, which is 10+ MPH faster than Usain Bolt). You&amp;#39;ve seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMmX-n1YGlA&quot;&gt;the Kevin Hart skit&lt;/a&gt;. Fear the Ostrich &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</content></item><item><title><![CDATA[2020-08-23]]></title><description><![CDATA[This week's topics: Mental Health]]></description><link>https://pliao39.com/weekly_notes/2020-08-23</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pliao39.com/weekly_notes/2020-08-23</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Phil Liao]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content type="html" xml:base="https://pliao39.com/weekly_notes/2020-08-23">&lt;p&gt;I started writing my notes yesterday and I just didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;have it&amp;quot;. Despite consecutive days of great sleep, solid exercise, and good weather, something was just off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, my parents and I sent my little brother off to college. I did not expect it to be a massive challenge, but the psychological effect on my parents has been brutal. Yes, there&amp;#39;s an element of empty nesting, which every parent goes through, but there&amp;#39;s also the circumstances around my brother&amp;#39;s college selection (he&amp;#39;s on a plan to transfer schools in his sophomore/junior year - anyone who&amp;#39;s been in that position knows the stress).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their emotions have stirred within me, a sense of unease. Combined with an increased level of anxiety from previous weeks and the result is cratering levels of productivity. Attempting to be productive right now feels as beneficial as running with increasingly painful shin splints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I won&amp;#39;t. This week, my only note will be a short one on mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mental-health&quot;&gt;Mental Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 2020, and we all know [[Mental Health]] is supremely important. We crave authenticity (after being flooded by people&amp;#39;s Best Selves‚Ñ¢ on [[Facebook]] and Instagram for years, we want to see real people). And we need &amp;quot;depressurized&amp;quot; spaces to talk and meet new people. And while the need is astronomical, I still think we&amp;#39;re extremely bad at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, mental health is a lot like physical health. In both, there are exercises you can do to improve (i.e. meditation and journaling on one side, squats and [[HIIT]] on the other). When you&amp;#39;re feeling healthy, either mentally or physically, you reap benefits to everything else in your life. On the other hand, if you are &amp;quot;injured&amp;quot;, even simple things can be difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unlike physical health, mental [[wellness]] is probably more complex and certainly harder to measure. When someone is physically healthy, you can look for obvious signals (healthy HR, BMI, VO2 max, etc). When someone has great mental health, how can you measure that? And how do you know if the measurement is accurate (not faked)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly have no answer for this, but I&amp;#39;m trying a few things to help me feel comfortable in all aspects of my life. It involves reading books on spiritual wellness, practicing mindfulness meditation and self care, improving my relationship with my parents, learning my history and heritage so I can be rooted in my identity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to start adding a books section on my personal site for this reason. When I&amp;#39;m having an issue with my mental health, I often find that the right book is the perfect medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, in addition to reading, I often find talking to my [[Otter]] app very useful. It&amp;#39;s just [[Audio]] transcription software, but it feels a bit like a therapist. It&amp;#39;s lower friction that writing and pairs nicely with journaling. But that&amp;#39;s just me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is to say that I&amp;#39;ve surprisingly found myself at the &amp;quot;bust&amp;quot; of another [[boom and bust]] cycle, one that I did not imagine would have come so soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel comfortable sharing, I&amp;#39;d love to hear from you - what strategies do you find effective when dealing with degraded mental health?&lt;/p&gt;

There&amp;#39;s a lot to say about the book - it&amp;#39;s tremendous - but today I&amp;#39;ll focus on one idea from the book, which is the necessity of mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to talk about [[Audio]]. So to expect two sections this week: mistakes, and audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mistakes&quot;&gt;Mistakes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to draw an image personifying spirituality, I might sketch a picture of a monk at a monastery, practicing sitting meditation and drinking tea. He has found peace - having renounced all worldly possessions. I&amp;#39;d draw his mouth with a subtle upward curve, to resemble the slightest of smiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly would not draw a gambler, mired in a midlife existential crisis, experiencing a nauseating level of depression. But that is precisely what our protagonist, Siddhartha, experienced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to experience despair, I had to sink to the greatest mental depths, to thoughts of suicide, in order to experience grace, to hear Om again, to sleep deeply again and to awaken refreshed again. I had to become a fool again in order to find Atman in myself. I had to sin in order to live again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something extremely relatable about despair. Whereas wild success is a rare fruit tasted only by a small fragment of civilization&amp;#39;s elite - all of us have known failure. Some to darker nadirs, but all of us know this suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what&amp;#39;s beautiful about this - is that the book shows us not only can we &amp;quot;bounce back&amp;quot; from the lowest points in our life, but they are actually necessary. Without them, you may gain an intellectual understanding of wisdom. But to truly know what wisdom and truth are, you must take your own unique path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my life, I find this question recur with frequency. Is it possible to &amp;quot;beeline&amp;quot; to peace? Or must you take the winding path? Or as my mother describes &amp;quot;ÂºØË∑Ø&amp;quot; - a torturous, bending road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineer in me says that optimization is possible. But all signs point elsewhere. We each have moments where we know something is wrong, something is off - but choose it anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take for example, this software engineer on a Reddit thread that I found recently. This young engineer took a job for prestige and is now miserable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate everything about it. I had a choice between a company with great people, better CoL and same pay and my current company.
The only thing better here is the prestige, I fell for it. I knew something felt off during the interview but I took the job anyway.
People here are assholes who live to work, pretend to be nice and backstab you as soon as they can.
Fuck them, fuck me. I wish I I could go back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/i3g44t/i_picked_a_job_for_the_prestige_and_i_regret_it/&quot;&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/i3g44t/i_picked_a_job_for_the_prestige_and_i_regret_it/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s this engineer. But we&amp;#39;ve all made that same decision before. And maybe not for prestige, but for reasons that we knew were wrong, but simply couldn&amp;#39;t override.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no lesson here. These are my notes. Not an essay. There is no point I&amp;#39;m trying to make. No argument I&amp;#39;m advancing. Simply that I thought the idea of [[Mistakes | mistakes]] as not only beneficial, but necessary for spiritual growth was deeply beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the number of times I have felt existential pangs as a consequence of my decisions - it&amp;#39;s possible that I&amp;#39;ve made enough mistakes to set the stage for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But probably not. I suspect I have many more mistakes ahead of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;audio&quot;&gt;Audio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so let&amp;#39;s change gears from the spiritual to the technical, and talk about audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re not familiar with these two articles, bookmark them and read them after you&amp;#39;ve consumed this piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexdanco.com/2019/10/17/the-audio-revolution/&quot;&gt;The Audio Revolution&lt;/a&gt; by Alex Danco&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/&quot;&gt;A Text Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; by Venkatesh Rao&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m certainly missing other blog posts/tweets on what I&amp;#39;m sure will be a trend of tech writers discussing the future of audio. I&amp;#39;m less interested in predictions on Audio though, and would rather focus on getting the pulse on what is out there today, and what I feel like each of these technologies might unleash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the style of Venkat&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;A Text Renaissance&amp;quot; (or at least the first half of that piece), I will briefly outline a series of technologies that I think have put us at the precipice of a Cambrian explosion in audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WebRTC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AirPods (and Fast Pair)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discord and Clubhouse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI Transcription&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podcasting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to skip around, these sections came out to be much longer than I anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;webrtc&quot;&gt;WebRTC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[WebRTC]] is here. Finally. After initial release in 2011, and so many teasers along the way, we&amp;#39;re finally at the point where browsers have deployed stable and high quality versions of WebRTC. In fact, the stable spec was only finalized on May 4, 2018 - and security vulnerabilities have been discovered and patched since. It&amp;#39;s been a long road, but it&amp;#39;s finally here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, developer productivity has seen massive benefits due to browser affordances like &amp;quot;flexbox&amp;quot;, native promises (leading to async/await), and countless other small improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for most of us, WebRTC was just a thing that was always on the horizon. But it sort of crept up on all of us, and now it&amp;#39;s there, ready for the tinkering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I don&amp;#39;t think this means the fall of Zoom anytime soon. Zoom has invested heavily in their own architecture and technology and probably have a massive lead on everyone. But that&amp;#39;s for video - which consumes significantly more bandwidth than audio and is a different kind of problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebRTC and audio work very well today. For example, my friends Azlen and Jon built &lt;a href=&quot;https://cozyroom.xyz/&quot;&gt;Cozyroom&lt;/a&gt;, which sits atop of WebRTC. They&amp;#39;ve since polished it after their humble hackathon beginnings, but these types of experiences are about to explode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myself, I&amp;#39;m working with Nick on &lt;a href=&quot;https://openhouse.substack.com/&quot;&gt;Openhouse&lt;/a&gt;. Which I&amp;#39;ll talk about much more in the future - but for now, know that it is a project built with the intention of learning WebRTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;airpods&quot;&gt;AirPods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a trend that didn&amp;#39;t really make a whole lot of sense to me at first. How does a stupid little accessory change the face of computing, especially since it doesn&amp;#39;t do anything structurally different from its corded predecessors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it changed a lot. It changed our fashion sensibilities around wearables. It changed how often we plug into audio. It taught us that we could replace our own thoughts with the voice/laugh of Joe Rogen.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has completely surprised Apple, demolishing their own &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/27/apple-doubling-airpods-pro-production-report/&quot;&gt;sales projections&lt;/a&gt;. And the demand for AirPods, feels as insatiable as the demand for Teslas in a world of unlimited access to a subprime auto loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not just AirPods. Apple&amp;#39;s forever copycat, Android, has finally shipped &amp;quot;Fast Pair&amp;quot; earbuds that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/products/android/fast-pair-easier-bluetooth/&quot;&gt;might not suck&lt;/a&gt;. When the proliferation of fashionable Android wireless earbuds finally hits mass adoption, get ready for a further acceleration of people escaping from their own thoughts via podcasts and other monkey mind pacifiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;discord-and-clubhouse&quot;&gt;Discord and Clubhouse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who still think Discord competes with Slack for communities... Where the hell have you been? It&amp;#39;s been my experience that all communities that have started after COVID-19 have chosen Discord, and the only Slack communities that I still get invites from are legacy ones, or businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s silly to think Discord and Slack compete on instant messaging. Slack is the &amp;quot;semi-async&amp;quot; text communication solution for startups, which competes with Microsoft Teams in the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discord is a social &lt;strong&gt;space&lt;/strong&gt; that embraces pseudonymity and gamers. It facilitates seamless jumping between communities (something that is an architectural impossibility given Slack&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.engineering/how-slack-built-shared-channels/&quot;&gt;sharded MySQL strategy&lt;/a&gt;), but most importantly (imo), it provides persistent voice channels for communities to congregate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These voice channels seemed stupid to me at first. Like why would you want an always open connection to friends that you can hop in and hop out of at any time? Why not just call them? Why would this change behavior at all? I mean, as far as the technology is concerned, this idea has ALWAYS been possible - so why didn&amp;#39;t it take off before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the reduction in friction to communicating with people does change behavior. It makes it feel like walking into a common room at a youth hostel and seeing who&amp;#39;s there. It creates audio serendipity in a way that is impossible on Slack. It feels like a physical space, made possible by... audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is a great segue into Clubhouse. See, Clubhouse and Discord share something in common. I described Discord voice channels via the metaphor of a &amp;quot;common room&amp;quot;. Well, in Clubhouse, the primary interface is a list of &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;rooms&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, or shared audio spaces - they lean into that metaphor big time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the larger rooms, there&amp;#39;s a small handful of speakers on stage enjoying a free-flowing (often moderated) discussion. All while an audience listens silently from their muted perch (audience members cannot speak unless selected by the moderator to join the stage). And in the smaller rooms, it&amp;#39;s a public, participatory discussion about anything random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clubhouse to me - and it might morph into something very different in the coming weeks, such is the pace of mutation - feels like a book festival. If you&amp;#39;ve never heard of a book festival, then you&amp;#39;re not alone. The only reason I know the term is I randomly found myself in Berkeley once upon a time - and it just so happened to be during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.baybookfest.org/content/2015/schedule.html&quot;&gt;first annual&lt;/a&gt; Bay Area book festival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a lot like a music festival, but instead of featuring musicians, there were authors and literary figures. And instead of performing music, they just talked. Different bookstores and theaters around Berkeley were all booked for the extravaganza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I opened Clubhouse for the first time, it felt like I was transported to downtown Berkeley for the book festival. There were a list of different talks happening right then, and list of upcoming events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It amazes me how audio, seems to create the illusion of spaces. Definitely not physically, but it creates an imaginative space that feels &amp;quot;cozy&amp;quot; in a way that Zoom and Google Meet simply do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m particularly excited about our Openhouse project because it allows for these affordances and to create spaces that can feel cozy. The internet is mutating, and open source is the highly editable RNA that powers the rapid evolution of new tech. I want to see a world where any community can embed a Clubhouse like experience on any site or in any app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if that happens, then we&amp;#39;ll chip away at the value prop of universities. Their lectures have already been digitized and commoditized. Now, with Clubhouse/Openhouse, we see talks, guest speakers, and seminars getting commoditized. We&amp;#39;re getting there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ai-transcription&quot;&gt;AI Transcription&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audio and Text have a very peculiar relationship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we had text messaging, we had phone calls. But before we had phones, we had mail. And before we wrote letters, we just talked to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audio and Text seem to come in alternating waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audio Transcription has been around for a long time. I remember many years ago, TJ-Maxx would sell last-year&amp;#39;s Dragon speech recognition software in their discount software section (well, I guess the entire store is a discount section, so apologies for that redundant adjective). But they were pretty limited back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, AI transcription is getting good. And it&amp;#39;s available as an API via things like Temi, [[Otter]], Trint (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-transcription-services/&quot;&gt;see comparison&lt;/a&gt;). But it&amp;#39;s not that good though yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can get really good AI transcription, for cheap, then audio and text will blur in ways we haven&amp;#39;t seen previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re not there yet, but watch this trend. As GPT-3 has proven, when we start throwing lots of parameters (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3&quot;&gt;175+ billion&lt;/a&gt;) and money (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hwfjej/d_the_cost_of_training_gpt3/&quot;&gt;millions of $&lt;/a&gt;) at a really really massive neural net, things start getting uncanny - or possibly, beyond uncanny (in the sense of crossing the uncanny chasm... err valley).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m no expert in AI, I barely understand what a neural network is (thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?&quot;&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt;, the first mover in unbundling the university), but I know to follow this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment we can get fast, highly-accurate automated transcription for cheap, the line between audio and text will blur so much that it&amp;#39;ll lead to innovations that are hard to predict. As is though, transcription seems to get something every sentence and that&amp;#39;s good, but not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phase change, when it comes, will come suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;podcasting&quot;&gt;Podcasting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have little to say about podcasting other than it is digitizing Radio for the AirPod generation. This has been a trend for years and is uninteresting because it&amp;#39;s so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thepodcasthost.com/listening/podcast-industry-stats/&quot;&gt;huge already&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be uninteresting, but it&amp;#39;s hugely important. According to Infinite Dial, about 55% of Americans have listened to a podcast in 2020, up from 33% in 2015. The shift in behavior has tipped to the majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love how podcasting is based on RSS, an architecturally open technology - which Apple has supported for years. I love that openness. It&amp;#39;s contribute to the rapid growth and proliferation of podcasting - the barrier to entry is so low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monetizing it will be a pain. The fact that it sits on top of RSS, an architecturally open technology, makes it more frustrating for podcasters to get stats on their listeners, which means less potent ad targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify has made a big play on podcasts, we&amp;#39;ll see how that plays out for them. The key here is to build the world&amp;#39;s best podcast player (classic &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/spotifys-podcast-aggregation-play/&quot;&gt;Aggregation Theory at play&lt;/a&gt;) and get everyone to use that. Then, once you have the user&amp;#39;s identity and listening history, you can drop targeted ads for days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Spotify doesn&amp;#39;t have the best podcast player, and it will probably be pretty hard to get me to switch to them. So they&amp;#39;ve resorted to exclusive deals with big names. It didn&amp;#39;t work for Mixer when they signed Ninja. Maybe it will work for Spotify though? The moment the aggregate demand though, they win. To do so, I think they&amp;#39;ll need a Google-search level quantum leap in utility over the current podcast players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, apologies for the digression on Spotify. What I really want to point out is you&amp;#39;ve probably heard all those Clubhassholes say stuff like &amp;quot;Clubhouse has completely replaced podcasts for me&amp;quot;. I think that&amp;#39;s actually how podcasting fits into this greater narrative of audio explosion - it is the gateway behavior to newer audio experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you podcast, then you clubhouse, then we all become Joaquin Phoenix with an ever present audio-presence in our ear canals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wrapping-it-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping it up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audio is exploding. You already knew that. But I hope you&amp;#39;ve gotten a better sense of &amp;quot;Why now?&amp;quot;, along with a few trends that might push us into explosive adoption of audio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podcasting as a gateway behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AirPods and Fast Pair as the physical enabler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WebRTC as the technological tectonic shift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discord and Clubhouse as the first successful innovators on this frontier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and AI Transcription maturing into a new &amp;quot;tinker&amp;quot; vector for future mutations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petri dish is ripe for a combinatorial expansion of random ideas in audio üß´üéß. Get excited!&lt;/p&gt;
</content></item><item><title><![CDATA[2020-08-09]]></title><description><![CDATA[This week's topics: Internet Friends, Internet Cities]]></description><link>https://pliao39.com/weekly_notes/2020-08-09</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pliao39.com/weekly_notes/2020-08-09</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Phil Liao]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 09 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content type="html" xml:base="https://pliao39.com/weekly_notes/2020-08-09">&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;#39;m in the mood of making predictions. Predictions on the rise of Internet Friends and Internet Cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are fledgling ideas and there&amp;#39;s a strong chance that I&amp;#39;m saying nothing new. Additionally, this might be more wishful thinking than thoughtful analysis. But I found these thoughts interesting enough and I want to develop some of them a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more personal side, this week wasn&amp;#39;t productive. That&amp;#39;s because I&amp;#39;m helping getting my parent&amp;#39;s house ready for a sale - lots of cleaning and staging. While exhausting and distracting, it yielded some unexpected psychic benefits. There&amp;#39;s something powerful about having a clean and beautiful living space. A physical manifestation of the ideas of [[Work Clean]] and &amp;quot;[[Fewer, more beautiful things]]&amp;quot; (an idea I haven&amp;#39;t yet explored, but certainly want to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another tiny personal update. After a conversation with a friend, I&amp;#39;ve developed a renewed commitment to personal development. That starts with re-listening to &amp;quot;The Power of Now&amp;quot; on audiobook, which sort of feels similar to listening to a spiritual lecture or sermon. And to put things into practice, I&amp;#39;m also re-listening to &amp;quot;Atomic Habits&amp;quot;. More on both of these topics in the future, but it felt necessary to mention them (you know, for the accountability).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;#39;s funny, I own a lot of audiobooks (Audible subscriber), but I seem to listen to the same ones over and over...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, now that all of that is out of the way, my predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;internet-friends&quot;&gt;Internet Friends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve made a handful of [[Internet Friends]] in 2020. The more I use Twitter, the more internet friends I&amp;#39;ve made. But it&amp;#39;s not just Twitter, I&amp;#39;ve also found internet friends on [[IndieHackers]] and [[MakerLog]] and various invite only Discords/Group chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more than I&amp;#39;ve ever made in all my previous years. In the past, I made practically all of my friends in the real world. I had a few Internet-only connections, but things like Discord and Zoom have changed the game. I used to know what people on the internet think like. Now, I know what they sound like. And what they laugh like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s obvious to say the future is going to be a whole lot more digital. But the second order effects on our social lives are going to be weird. Imagine a world in which half of your friends you&amp;#39;ve met in person and the other half online. (Which is a strange distinction - &amp;quot;in person&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;online&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important to consider because meeting people online is different. You can actually meet someone online for the first time without interacting with them at all. You can visit their profile and read up on how they want to present themselves. Or better yet, if they have a website, you can spend a moment immersed in their brain. All without ever meeting them. And they can do the same for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Friends are typically more aligned with you, in terms of how you think. In the past, location was king. Now, thoughts and values reign supreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another fascinating wrinkle - you can have multiple identities. And none of them have to be associated with your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trend is massively important to understand. It&amp;#39;s going to fundamentally shake our conception of what it means to be social and what it means to be friends. Right now, people sort of understand this. But the new tools that we&amp;#39;ve gotten recently (video chat via Zoom/Google Meets, audio discussion with voyeurism as a feature via Clubhouse/Discord) are changing the dynamics of how &amp;quot;close&amp;quot;, an Internet Friend can feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these tools are a disruptive innovation to friendship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let that sink in - Friendship is getting disrupted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience is worse in important ways (you can&amp;#39;t hug or high five or share food), but better in many others (meet people on the merit of thoughts and values, without restriction to geography).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means producing content (writing, videos, art, etc) is going to be hugely important. Your content is the new coffee chat - it replaces the first meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no game plan for what you need to do to position yourself for this change, but I believe building your own personal site is at the core. It&amp;#39;s highly related to the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.vc/trends-0023-personal-brands/&quot;&gt;Personal Brands&lt;/a&gt; that Dru Riley explored, but in this case, it&amp;#39;s not about business. It&amp;#39;s more about being a person of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;internet-cities&quot;&gt;Internet Cities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, I stumbled across &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bogleheads.org/AboutUs.php&quot;&gt;Bogleheads&lt;/a&gt; and it felt like visiting another world. From my internet spaceship (Firefox), I had touched down and landed on a strange planet, a place called Bogleheads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My visit was short, but it was fascinating to explore this backwater. For about 10 minutes, I immersed myself in a culture of responsible personal finance (Bogleheads take their name from John Bogle, the founder of Vanguard and champion of ETF &amp;quot;set it and forget it&amp;quot; type investing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogleheads is an old community. It started in 1998 as a subcommunity of the MorningStar forums, and then in 2007 branched off to settle new territory. Those MorningStar Internet Pilgrims spun up phpBB and created a new town square dedicated to the creed of John Bogle. Over time, this little Internet City sprawled with more low-code tools, adding a wiki (mediaWiki), and a blog (WordPress). In 2020, it&amp;#39;s still a lively little city, but it certainly feels dated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take for example, a newer digital community like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiehackers.com/&quot;&gt;IndieHackers&lt;/a&gt;, which itself is entirely custom. Built on Firebase, IndieHackers is a new type of Internet City that doesn&amp;#39;t use off the shelf parts. Thus, it has its own distinctive feel - that&amp;#39;s reminiscent of Reddit or HackerNews, but altogether quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe we are about to see the founding of a great number of new [[Internet Cities]] over the next few years. Some may call them communities, but I think they&amp;#39;re closer to [[MMO RPG]]s, that will share similarities to cities. These &amp;quot;communities&amp;quot; will have job boards, and commerce, and events, and governance. You might pay a tax to the community (a membership fee, or a transaction fee on all commerce), or more likely, it will be sponsored by a corporation (in the way IndieHackers is today by Stripe). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the great digitization of our social and professional lives means that interest based Internet Cities are begging to be created. In the future, we&amp;#39;ll probably spend most of our time interacting in Internet Cities and Towns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, we already spend a ton of time on these Internet Cities. To me, Twitter feels like the Big City, Bogleheads feels like the a small town in the Midwest, and IndieHackers feels like a young Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if this idea makes any sense to you, but I&amp;#39;m excited for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to be fun.&lt;/p&gt;
</content></item><item><title><![CDATA[2020-08-02]]></title><description><![CDATA[This week's topics: Authenticity, Two Energies, Multiple Discovery]]></description><link>https://pliao39.com/weekly_notes/2020-08-02</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pliao39.com/weekly_notes/2020-08-02</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Phil Liao]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content type="html" xml:base="https://pliao39.com/weekly_notes/2020-08-02">&lt;p&gt;This week I had a ton of anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t write about the root cause, yet I felt that it was important to recognize this, because A) it makes me feel better to do so and B)  if there&amp;#39;s something on my mind and I don&amp;#39;t write about it - well, that&amp;#39;s a bit inauthentic and these notes are supposed to be authentic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is a good segue into this week&amp;#39;s first topic - [[Authenticity]]. But before we do that, I&amp;#39;d like to update you that I have indeed conquered last week&amp;#39;s challenge. The [[Vue]] plugin for &lt;a href=&quot;https://feather.id/&quot;&gt;Feather&lt;/a&gt; is out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/feather-client-vue&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;authenticity&quot;&gt;Authenticity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being authentic on the internet is hard. When anyone can see what you&amp;#39;ve posted, you must proceed with some degree of caution. The fact that I started these notes by redacting the root cause of my anxiety is an example of me exercising that caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Cancel culture&amp;quot; has revealed how simple it is to weaponize someone&amp;#39;s past comments against them on the internet. Anything you say can and will be used against. You have the right to remain silent. But [[cancel culture]] isn&amp;#39;t what I want to focus on today - maybe another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, I want to talk about the inner challenge of being authentic online. The challenge of finding your voice in the face of fear - the fear of being perceived as &amp;quot;less than perfect&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us want to be [[perfect]] online. Not in the sense that we have no flaws, but more so that we want to invoke admiration in others. I want others to be like &amp;quot;oh man, I think Phil is great. He&amp;#39;s thoughtful, original, etc&amp;quot; and I suspect most others want something to that effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what I&amp;#39;ve found is that aiming for perfection tends to lead to two outcomes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your work becomes performative &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first case, you never publish, for fear of not being perfect. And in the second, your work sounds off - forced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Perell has an interesting take on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are bad writers, but excellent text messagers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their writing is bad because they try to sound smart once they open Microsoft Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when they text, they write with clarity and enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre stuck, write like you‚Äôre sending an important text message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1240836363190222848?s=20&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1240836363190222848?s=20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performative work is cringeworthy, even if the underlying work is valuable. It lacks voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is the solution to simply &amp;quot;write with voice&amp;quot;? I don&amp;#39;t think so. Voice isn&amp;#39;t something you turn on or off. Voice is nurtured, and not just by you, but by engaging with others. You reflect on your style, you evaluate what elements of your work you like, and what you don&amp;#39;t. You put it in front of others and you listen to what they say. Voice is a beautiful thing - if writing is a form of self expression, then writing with voice is prose that has expressed the self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem isn&amp;#39;t that someone has &amp;quot;voice&amp;quot; and simply needs to choose to use it. The problem is more that your voice needs to be nurtured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, it&amp;#39;s a better goal to produce work that is interesting to yourself. With a low bar for quality. Giving yourself permission to write about what you want, without regard for how it&amp;#39;s perceived will give you wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See, this is why I write these notes. This concept is half baked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;two-energies&quot;&gt;Two Energies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I experienced a sharp turn in my energy levels. Monday and Tuesday were great. Then, something happened on Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ability to think abstract thoughts and generate any semblance of creative work left my brain. I felt like [[Cinderella]] when the clock struck 12, or that movie [[Limitless]] when the Adderall++ pills began to wear off. The magic faded away and thereafter, I was forced to welcome the reign of tiredness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens to me a lot. I seem to operate in two forms, one in which ideas and productivity comes naturally - and another in which everything is a struggle. I don&amp;#39;t drink caffeine, and maybe that&amp;#39;s part of my problem, but I find that these &amp;quot;two energies&amp;quot; and the transition between them feels a lot like the [[boom and bust]] cycle of the stock market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The [[bull]] market run up to feeling good is rooted in strong personal [[wellness]] fundamentals (good sleep, exercise, diet, and psychological care), but as the good times roll on, those fundamentals slowly (or quickly) fall by the wayside. Things continue to go well, but a reckoning is awaiting. Lack of sleep. Burnout. Anxiety. A crash. The [[bear]] falls into a sudden hibernation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s kind of where I&amp;#39;m at right now. Wednesday was the bust in my boom and bust energy cycle, and the last few days, things went from bad to worse, and here I am trying to re-invest in the fundamentals to get myself firing on all cylinders again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;multiple-discovery&quot;&gt;Multiple Discovery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was going to publish these notes on Sunday, but because I didn&amp;#39;t get to it, I thought I&amp;#39;d throw in a bonus this morning (Monday 08-03).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One idea that popped up on my radar last week (a couple times) was the idea of [[multiple discovery]], or the idea that an invention or a discovery happens at the same time at different places in the world. We often cite Leibniz and Newton discovering Calculus or Wallace and Darwin discovering Evolution as stories of when this occurs in science. Of course, the list of this is enormous:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multiple_discoveries&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multiple_discoveries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a similar phenomenon in Hollywood, called &amp;quot;Twin films&amp;quot;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_films&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s not just Hollywood and Science - this happens ALL the time in business. From billionaire entrepreneurs who both happen to have side businesses that produce rockets (Bezos/Musk) to your average SaaS product that has dozens of competitors, multiple discovery is a very human thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why does this happen in so many disciplines? One might be tempted to say that we&amp;#39;re less original than we think we are - and I think that would be 100% correct. But it goes a little further than that. I hypothesize there are a LIMITED set of things that CAN be discovered/invented/built at any given point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have zero experience in science and film so I&amp;#39;ll refrain from making any generalizations there. But I believe that when it comes to business, there are a limited number of solutions that the market is able to accept at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It depends on the skills of the consumers (do they know how to use Smartphones, do they know how to type on a keyboard?) and the taste of the market. There&amp;#39;s an element of fashion to business, and I wish we&amp;#39;d understand that better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on the consumer side, there are a limited number of things they will respond positively to. And on the entrepreneur side, people have extremely similar information diets. So the space of &amp;quot;valid ideas&amp;quot; is actually very small, leading to plenty of collisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I tweeted out this idea: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That idea you have? There&amp;#39;s pretty much a 100% chance someone else has the exact same one and is executing on it TODAY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pliao39/status/1288900847309664256?s=20&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/pliao39/status/1288900847309664256?s=20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I believe that we now live in a world that&amp;#39;s going to become ultra competitive. Get used to it. In a world with billions of humans, all coming online, multiple discovery will be the norm in everything (if it wasn&amp;#39;t already).&lt;/p&gt;

After a conversation with a friend on Tuesday, I&amp;#39;ve decided that my inability to stick with a &amp;quot;Weekly Reflection&amp;quot; routine has simply because I lacked accountability. Combined with my desire to perform &amp;quot;post processing&amp;quot; on my Roam Notes (which itself is a [[forcing function]] to take better Roam Notes), I&amp;#39;m publishing a set of notes from each week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re not meant to be read weekly, but I&amp;#39;ve got to tidy up my thoughts somehow. This is that somehow. Future posts and essays will likely have their origins in these weekly notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the backlinks don&amp;#39;t go anywhere for now. I&amp;#39;m using &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsidian.md&quot;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; to write these markdown notes, and there&amp;#39;s utility for me to add them. One day, I might build a UI in which readers can jump between these links and explore them - semi-Roam style. In other words, these links are purely for my benefit, but one day, they might be more useful to you, the reader, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, those broken backlinks are a metaphor for these weekly notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;work-clean&quot;&gt;Work Clean!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I was struck by how important it is to [[Work Clean]]. Every morning I spend so much time rearranging my workspace by wrangling in a cacophony of browser tabs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who has tried Mari Kondo&amp;#39;s [[Spark Joy]], you know that sentimental items are hard to toss. And in a way, I form sentimental attachments to tabs I have opened, but haven&amp;#39;t read. Each of those tabs feels like it has life-changing potential - and that makes them plausibly valuable. I&amp;#39;m excited to read them, perhaps primed by some form of [[social proof]] in the form of a Tweet, or a large number of upvotes on [[HackerNews]], yet I never asked myself, &amp;quot;Is this really worth reading?&amp;quot;. In other words, I don&amp;#39;t do the important work of [[pre-reading]]. But I should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus, every morning, I start in the red. I clean up after the previous day&amp;#39;s irresponsibility - of spawning browser tabs filled with potential, but no certain value. And this clean up is draining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what&amp;#39;s worse is if I don&amp;#39;t clean up. My computer begins to run hot, its fans spinning ever faster as it attempts to dissipate heat, and emitting the sound of exhaustion - its version of panting. And those tabs that my computer is working to maintain, those tabs are black holes for productivity. If I accidentally open one, or see a certain tab, then my brain begins a subconscious context switch, which I have to interrupt, and refocus. That costs mental energy. And if I don&amp;#39;t interrupt, well I&amp;#39;m jumping down a 10 minute or so rabbit hole of distraction, thinking about a random topic I had no intention of exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heat from my computer, the torrent of air emitted by its fan, and the context switches from seeing an unwanted browser tab slowly brings my productivity to a crawl. It&amp;#39;s a death by a thousand papercuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, it&amp;#39;s better to clean up every morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But would be better to work clean. Mise en place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-and-drowning&quot;&gt;Learning and Drowning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been struck by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtfTOuSHGg8&quot;&gt;Michael Siebel&amp;#39;s observation&lt;/a&gt; that successful startup founders are [[formidable]]. Essentially, a person is formidable if they are able to accomplish exactly what they set out to accomplish. &amp;quot;I will sign 10 customers this week&amp;quot; and then go out and do that very daunting task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formidable people are forces to be reckoned with. Because they find ways to consistently push themselves and operate at the edge of what is possible, they become super human. But, I believe this is an outsider&amp;#39;s view of a successful, productive person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inside view of a formidable person is actually the development of [[confidence]] and [[self-esteem]], bordering into arrogance and over-confidence, but not quite. And while I will talk a lot more about self-esteem in the future, I want to touch briefly about the origins of confidence and self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-esteem comes from a place of believing &amp;quot;I am worthy&amp;quot;, regardless of how much I fail or how much society hates me. You must give yourself permission to be. Simply to be. &amp;quot;I am who I am and I am worthy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For young people, this can come from your parents. I recall [[Kobe]] saying in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY0wONSarXA&quot;&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt;, that his father did exactly that. He was 10 or 11 at the time and went to a summer camp, playing against other 10 or 11 year olds, and where his father and uncle had played in their youth and done well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Kobe scored 0 points, the entire summer. His quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I scored, not a free throw, nothing - not a lucky shot, not a breakaway layup. Zero points. And I remember crying about it and being upset about it, and my father gives me a hug and says, &amp;quot;Listen, whether you score 0 or you score 60, I&amp;#39;m gonna love you no matter what.&amp;quot; Now that is the most important thing you can say to a child. Because from there I was like &amp;quot;okay&amp;quot;, that gives me all the confidence in the world to fail. I have the security there. But to hell with that, I&amp;#39;m scoring 60. Let&amp;#39;s go. From there, I just went to work.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what&amp;#39;s amazing about this is those words from Kobe&amp;#39;s father gave him that sense of self worth. To become formidable you need a bedrock of love, that safety net to fail and still be worthy of love. Young people get it from their parents and others. Older people must learn to build that sense of self appreciation themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kobe was formidable, but had his father not been there for him, who knows what if we would associate the name Kobe with basketball royalty or a type of beef (after which Kobe was named). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so this is a long winded way to make a point about Learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I was learning [[Vue]] and made great initial progress. In 7 days, I went from complete noob to a working component that did exactly what I wanted it to do. And then I hit a massive roadblock. I was at the point of packaging my work and putting it on npm as a Vue plugin, and suddenly my momentum crashed as I was stonewalled by an unmoveable object. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, it felt like drowning out at sea. All that confidence and momentum was gone. Now, I have to build up my knowledge of bundling (which I have almost none of, because that&amp;#39;s almost always abstracted away from me) and slowly piece together the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And right now, I certainly don&amp;#39;t feel formidable. In fact, I feel the complete opposite - incompetent. It&amp;#39;s in this very moment, where this practice of weekly reflection comes in - I&amp;#39;m practicing self appreciation and a giving myself that foundation of worthiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sensation of drowning, of spending an entire summer and scoring 0 points, of spending days on an npm packaging problem with no results, will test your confidence. But to fall back onto a belief that &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m worthy of being me, failures and all&amp;quot; - well that, as Kobe said &amp;quot;gives you all the confidence in the world&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon that safety-net of self belief and appreciation, I&amp;#39;m gonna get this Vue package out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark my words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;questions&quot;&gt;Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always been a somewhat curious person, but I think I&amp;#39;ve relied on my natural curiosity and haven&amp;#39;t developed an intentional &amp;quot;question practice&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions are extremely important. They have a way of priming the mind and sharpening focus. They can be used as an attack (i.e. &amp;quot;What do you mean?&amp;quot;). They can reframe a problem (i.e. &amp;quot;What if&amp;quot;). They can be used to challenge assumptions (i.e. &amp;quot;Why do we believe this?&amp;quot;). Questions change the tone. Questions break you out of your normal thinking patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On HackerNews, there was a post this week titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anup.io/2020/07/20/invert-always-invert/&quot;&gt;Invert, Always Invert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core idea is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define the problem - what are you trying to achieve?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invert it - what would guarantee failure?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, consider solutions to avoid this failure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s funny how powerful this can be. Thinking of the same problem from the opposite perspective. Hiking the same trail looks different on the return trip - inversion makes the familiar feel new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good questions activate the mind. A new friend of mine (the one who prompted these weekly_notes) asked me &amp;quot;What was the one thing at Uber that you were most excited about or passionate working on?&amp;quot; and it was a good question because I honestly couldn&amp;#39;t answer it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work wasn&amp;#39;t done for passion or purpose, but pragmatism. And perhaps that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m doing what I&amp;#39;m doing now. Writing^1 and building as a way to make sense of the world - flailing (ahem, writing and building) my way to passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;^1 - (&lt;a href=&quot;https://softwarementor.substack.com/&quot;&gt;Software Mentor&lt;/a&gt;, and now these weekly notes, to go along with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://spacetime.substack.com/&quot;&gt;Spacetime Newsletter&lt;/a&gt; which is basically just a public journal of what Nick and I are building) &lt;/p&gt;

Everyone seems to have a pair. Estimates show that revenue generated from AirPods is hitting an annual run rate in the billions. If AirPods were a startup, it‚Äôd easily be a decacorn. Not bad for a product that was widely panned by Silicon Valley (except Chris Messina, who proved &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/chris-messina/silicon-valley-is-all-wrong-about-the-airpods-8204ede08f0f&quot;&gt;prophetic&lt;/a&gt;) at its launch in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What lessons can we draw from a product that has infiltrated the ear canals of millions, with projections to reach tens of millions more? Here are three:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small Delights&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Naming Matters&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Real Life Virality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;small-delights&quot;&gt;Small Delights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first started using AirPods, I noticed small delights:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The charging case‚Äôs magnetic snappiness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seamless pairing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A battery indicator appearing on your iPhone when the case is opened&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ‚ÄúAirPods have graced your ears‚Äù sound when you put them in&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pause on removal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A tiny green light on the case that tells you everything is alright, and the smooth fade to orange when the AirPods return home to charge&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fast charging&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The case‚Äôs smooth contours&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By themselves, none of these details is enough to win you over, but in their aggregate, AirPods deliver a cascading combo of magic moments that leave you enchanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stack magic moments and customers will fall for your product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;naming-matters&quot;&gt;Naming Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2016, AirPods was a new product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs imagine for a moment that they were instead named Apple Buds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would the product still have taken off? Probably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But doing so would have been a wasted opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A name is a young products‚Äô most effective marketing weapons. It can evoke an emotion or feeling (Fast, Uber). It can be suggestive of a style or aesthetic (Warby Parker -&amp;gt; Hipster). It can also hint at a product‚Äôs function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of AirPods, by channeling their own history (the iPod), and mashing that with a word that previews the product‚Äôs primary value add (Air = wireless), Apple generated an iconic name that practically explains the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apple Buds - Conveys, these are some earbuds from Apple&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apple AirPods - Conveys, this is some wireless device that is important for music&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Names matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you pick a great name? I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a formula you can follow (or at least, I know of none). But here are some thoughts on good names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They are easily pronounceable (for the target audience)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They hint at the products‚Äô function&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They utilize good metaphors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They have character&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example of a product that has all of these:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stripe - uses a playful metaphor (the magnetic stripe on a credit card) ¬†to hint at the product‚Äôs function&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Character is undoubtedly the most tricky thing here, but I think it‚Äôs often the most important. Could a story be told about how a customer uses your product? Does your product‚Äôs name fit in this story? Does it flow naturally, or does it sound misplaced? If it fits, you‚Äôve probably got a winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, here‚Äôs a process you CAN (and probably should) follow. Pick a fallback name (Apple was a fallback name) and stick with it until something better comes along. Stripe was originally called dev/payments, until one day, they figured to call themselves Stripe. When you stumble upon a name that‚Äôs so much better than the fallback, the decision to change will be effortless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;real-life-virality&quot;&gt;Real Life Virality&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;AirPods are viral. They‚Äôre bright white and stand out in a crowd. Simply by using them, AirPod owners are providing Apple with free impressions on future potential customers. Every time someone walks onto the subway wearing AirPods, someone else goes ‚ÄúHmm, those AirPods are everywhere‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if AirPod adoption is higher in places where public transportation use is high. Or, perhaps, among cohorts of people who utilize public transportation versus those who commute in solitude (i.e. driving).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Chen recently wrote about this &lt;a href=&quot;https://andrewchen.co/irl-channel/&quot;&gt;IRL Channel&lt;/a&gt; of growth. It‚Äôs the phenomenon where digital products, when used in the real world, form impressions on new customers and spur further growth. This is a type of virality enjoyed by AirPods, Uber/Lyft, Amazon Echo, and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there an element of real life usage in your product? Can you accentuate it? ¬†Red JUMP bikes stand out more than other bike share products. The neon pink Lyft mustache dashboard lights stood out more than whatever Uber was doing at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capitalize on real life virality!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success of AirPods cannot be attributed to only these three elements (i.e. Apple removed the headphone jack from the iPhone!), but consider them useful tools if you‚Äôre trying to create a blockbuster product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy hacking!&lt;/p&gt;</content></item><item><title><![CDATA[itchier]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bootstrappers are alchemists.

They produce a product people love, profits, and a lifestyle of freedom - all from seemingly thin air. How do they do it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alas, I haven‚Äôt figured that out. But I think I found the first step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;scratch&quot;&gt;Scratch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful entrepreneurs solve their own problems:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shopify&lt;/strong&gt; - Tobi wanted to sell snowboards online&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nomad List &lt;/strong&gt;- Pieter wanted to find cheap travel destinations with good wifi, and good weather&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stripe&lt;/strong&gt; - The Collison brothers (the elder two) had sold their last business and realized how difficult it was setting up online payments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basecamp&lt;/strong&gt; - Jason‚Äôs web consultancy couldn‚Äôt find a project management suite that stuck. Borne of frustration, they built their own.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airbnb&lt;/strong&gt; - Joe and Brian couldn‚Äôt make rent, but they had an extra airbed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, they ‚Äúscratch their own itch‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôll find this advice everywhere on the Internet. So much so you might have grown numb to its wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know I did. I saw it so many times, I began to confuse familiarity with understanding. I thought it meant:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find one of my problems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;See if others also have the problem&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Test if they‚Äôre willing to pay for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that‚Äôs not what it means. All ‚Äúscratch your itch‚Äù means is solve your own problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full stop. Nothing else. Nothing about finding paying customers. Just scratch your own itch, and no more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;makers&quot;&gt;Makers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What?! That‚Äôs literally the opposite of everything I‚Äôve read about market validation!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You see, something important needs to happen first - a change within your own mind. Instead of focusing on making money, you need to focus on making. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/140-arvid-kahl-of-feedbackpanda&quot;&gt;an IndieHackers podcast between Courtland Allen and Arvid Kahl&lt;/a&gt; and they both talked about the importance of finding a good market. In the past, they worked on unsuccessful businesses and didn‚Äôt want to repeat their mistakes. And thus, it was important for them to start a business with the wind behind their backs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs essential advice. But notice a key detail - they had failed at previous endeavors (Arvid around the 45:00 mark, Courtland mentions his past stumbles on the podcast all the time). They were &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;makers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;metamorphosis&quot;&gt;Metamorphosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, I conflated coding ability with being a maker. They are not the same. Working at a startup doesn‚Äôt make you one either. In fact, you can be a maker without knowing how to code. A maker is someone who lives this entire process: ideation, building, shipping, engaging passionate fans, and incorporating feedback. It‚Äôs an identity, a habit, not a skillset. And once you do all of that, something fascinating happens:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You grow more empathetic&lt;/strong&gt;. You get excited to show customers changes you‚Äôve made. You await their response. When they point out a broken experience, you run back to your computer and fix it. And then you send it to them again. Maybe they‚Äôll say thank you for solving something painful. When that happens, that‚Äôs the best reward. It‚Äôs why we do what we do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But perhaps the most amusing thing is &lt;strong&gt;you get ‚Äúitchier‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt;. The confidence you‚Äôve built up from shipping will change how you see the world. You start seeing more solvable problems - you get &lt;strong&gt;more and better ideas&lt;/strong&gt;. Which motivates you to build and ship. And when you do, you get itchier again. It&apos;s a virtuous cycle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becoming ‚Äúitchier‚Äù is key to the bootstrapper‚Äôs journey. It motivates you to build, ship, listen, learn, and grow. It helps you find better ideas. It helps you meet people. And all you need to do to kick off this incredible metamorphosis is to ‚Äúscratch your own itch‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;</content></item><item><title><![CDATA[idea-to-product-hunt-launch]]></title><description><![CDATA[Two weeks ago, I launched Emoji cp [http://emojicp.com/] on Product Hunt

Thus, you‚Äôre left to experiment with the thumbnail and the tagline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm no master of the thumbnail, but I have a tip for the tagline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the constrained real estate, there‚Äôs only space to convey your &lt;em&gt;differentiated&lt;/em&gt; value. What makes your product pop?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To jumpstart your brainstorm, here are products with taglines that rock:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Superhuman - The fastest email experience ever made&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good Eggs - Absurdly fresh groceries, delivered&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yellowtail Wines - Great tasting, quality wines for everyone to enjoy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DuckDuckGo - The search engine that doesn‚Äôt track you (informal tagline)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice how they all differentiate themselves:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Superhuman is &lt;strong&gt;faster&lt;/strong&gt; ‚ö°Ô∏è&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good Eggs is &lt;strong&gt;fresher&lt;/strong&gt; ü•¨&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yellowtail Wines is &lt;strong&gt;more approachable&lt;/strong&gt; üëã&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DuckDuckGo is &lt;strong&gt;more private&lt;/strong&gt; üòé&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you launch, prepare your hard-hitting, differentiated 60 character pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;voter-turnout&quot;&gt;Voter Turnout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just lied when I said you can only control 4 sections in your launch widget (sorry!). The upvote count is actually a bit more in your control than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product Hunt‚Äôs launch guide (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.producthunt.com/how-to-launch-on-product-hunt-7c1843e06399&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) encourages you to reach out to friends on Facebook and followers on Twitter. They discourage asking for upvotes, but encourage organic, authentic sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Emoji cp, I made a Twitter post, which 3 friends presumably saw, as they upvoted Emoji cp within an hour. I can‚Äôt tell if they enjoyed the product, or if they were showing their support (or both), but their upvotes made a difference! (Thanks guys ‚ù§Ô∏è)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first hour of launch, products jostle for position. In a hierarchical game like Product Hunt, products at the top accrue advantages. This is for a couple reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traffic&lt;/strong&gt; - many people never scroll past the 5th product. Furthermore, products in the bottom half are hidden behind a ‚Äúload more‚Äù button. Thus, products at the top receive an unfair amount of traffic compared to products at the bottom. Assuming your widget converts at a fixed percentage: More traffic (üö¶) = More upvotes (‚¨ÜÔ∏è).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence&lt;/strong&gt; - when a product has a lot of upvotes, it influences others to give it more of a chance. Some people will upvote only once there are sufficient upvotes. (Subconsciously, I&apos;m kind of like this). So really, More upvotes = Better conversion! The power of the herd is strong üêÆ&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early upvotes from friends and followers give you an early boost in the rankings. And then, the benefits of increased &lt;strong&gt;traffic&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;influence&lt;/strong&gt; start working for you, not against you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voter turnout matters - get your constituency behind you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Btw, if you‚Äôre launching a product on Product Hunt, make sure you let me know. Knowing what I now know, I&apos;ll help you out! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-consistent&quot;&gt;Be Consistent&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emoji cp‚Äôs Product Hunt launch had one big problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tagline on the website and the tagline on Product Hunt were different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Website: Search for emoji. Click (or press Enter) to copy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ProductHunt: Find and copy emoji, fast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If customers like your product, they‚Äôll want to tell their friends. When they do that, they‚Äôll use some variation of your tagline. If you have multiple taglines, customers need to decide which one to use - &lt;strong&gt;IF&lt;/strong&gt; they can even remember any of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have one way of talking about your product. Use it as your Product Hunt tagline. Put it on your website. Use it in your tweets. Be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caveat: you want to avoid semantic satiation. So on the same page, do not use the tagline 25 times. Rather, the idea here is to keep a consistent tagline across &lt;strong&gt;distinct&lt;/strong&gt; impressions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A successful Product Hunt launch can accelerate your product&apos;s adoption by weeks - and it&apos;s useful to get it right. Emoji cp was a fun side project of mine, so I didn&apos;t take it as seriously as others on Product Hunt do. That said, I learned some serious lessons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;60 Character Pitch&lt;/strong&gt; - differentiate yourself with a value-dense tagline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voter Turnout&lt;/strong&gt; - Upvotes beget more upvotes, so get your people out to the polls&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Consistent&lt;/strong&gt; - Make it easier for word of mouth to take off and be consistent with your language&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it&apos;s important to note that Product Hunt‚Äôs greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. Product Hunt drives traffic to you. It‚Äôs good at answering the question: ‚ÄúDo a lot of people like this product at least a little bit?‚Äù. It does not really give you an answer for the more important question: ‚ÄúDoes anyone love this product?‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For true insights, you need to listen to your fans. The comments section on Product Hunt is helpful (I received two roadmap suggestions that hinted at where Emoji cp should go), but you‚Äôll need to dig for insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funny enough, the most important piece of customer feedback I received wasn‚Äôt on Product Hunt at all! It came from a post I made to MakerLog:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;kg-card kg-image-card&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3SMhng0QHQpD1AeQdfV3cwwxSveAbUFgLc4ooadWZ6TV3RY_RB3ZBNCWlI9QuDCjUqtHHDGwXbWatygpZGjhME9AVcfgk0OXLfDstAjRb3ktbr3xyMiv-ZiV182QZlazbuegDpP0&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which led to a fellow Maker to send out this tweet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;kg-card kg-embed-card&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Been using &amp;quot;Emoji cp&amp;quot; all day and totally loving it&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‚å®Ô∏è Type to search, up/down arrows to select, Enter to copy&lt;br&gt;üëê No need to lift hands off keyboard&lt;br&gt;üñ±Ô∏è Mouse usage optional&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‚ö° Fastest emoji site i&amp;#39;ve used by far!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;website: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/7oCGOfAXRL&quot;&gt;https://t.co/7oCGOfAXRL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;creator: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pliao39?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pliao39&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/7TUJGLviLq&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/7TUJGLviLq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Carl Poppa (@poppacalypse) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/poppacalypse/status/1206471682539409408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 16, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This singular tweet was arguably just as important to me as the Product Hunt launch. The value proposition was validated (at least by one user), and it made it üíØ% clear to me what made Emoji cp different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A successful Product Hunt launch is great, but remember that it&apos;s just a start. Leverage that influx of users to find your true fans - and that&apos;s where the real work begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy Hunting!&lt;/p&gt;</content></item><item><title><![CDATA[job-search]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is the story of my job search.

For the last 3 months, I had been traveling solo in Asia. After being laid off from my last company, a solo trip was just what the doctor ordered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was away, one of my roommates, Richard (not his real name), quit his job and moved into full-time job search mode. Richard is also a software engineer and his job search process was fascinating. He failed 3 Technical Phone Screens and 5 onsites before his first offer. That‚Äôs 8 ‚ÄúNo‚Äôs‚Äù before the first ‚ÄúYes‚Äù. And after accumulating those scars, he had gotten pretty solid at interviews. Richard became my sherpa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs the advice he gave me:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get ready for lots of BFS/DFS problems. Some good ones: &lt;a href=&quot;https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands&quot;&gt;https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island&quot;&gt;https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://leetcode.com/problems/minesweeper&quot;&gt;https://leetcode.com/problems/minesweeper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For some reason, the LRU cache problem comes up a lot. Think about it too: &lt;a href=&quot;https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache&quot;&gt;https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get used to rejection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do a few problems from each chapter of ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/&quot;&gt;Cracking the Coding Interview&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù, no need to do all of them (although that won‚Äôt hurt).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://triplebyte.com&quot;&gt;Triplebyte&lt;/a&gt;. But definitely prepare before you take the TripleByte quiz. (Triplebyte is how Richard found his first job a couple years back)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mere knowledge that Richard had gone through his own struggles before landing at Google was comforting. And with that, I began the first steps of the job search: Identifying Opportunities, Networking and Resume Polishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;identifying-opportunities&quot;&gt;Identifying Opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started with a list of companies that interested me. These were companies that I was impressed by from a distance, either through blog posts (often authored by the company themselves), podcasts, or from people in my network. AngelList puts out curated lists of companies they call ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://angel.co/job-collections&quot;&gt;job collections&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù which I drew upon for inspiration. I referenced the &lt;a href=&quot;https://breakoutlist.com/&quot;&gt;Breakout List&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.wealthfront.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018_Career-Launching_List-10.pdf&quot;&gt;Wealthfront‚Äôs List of Career Launching companies&lt;/a&gt;, although those sources are sparse on useful information. Next, I glanced at the list of portfolio companies at some well known VCs. From these mostly nebulous sources, I made three lists: Low-Mid Interest, Mid-High Interest and Crypto companies. Finally, I used Glassdoor reviews to sanity check if any of the companies on my list had red flags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn‚Äôt discover &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.keyvalues.com/&quot;&gt;Key Values&lt;/a&gt; until week 4 of my process, but I wish I found it earlier. Key Values is a website that helps engineers find teams that share their cultural values. The profiles on Key Values are the closest thing to a company‚Äôs culture resume anywhere on the internet. Two reasons why I wish I knew about Key Values in week 1:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would have pushed me to think about culture even more. Up until this point, I had been evaluating companies based on three things: chance of financial success, mission alignment (did I care about the product?), and perceived operational efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would have found more companies (By week 4, I was mostly executing off of the lists I formed in weeks 1 and 2)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;More on Key Values in the Appendix! But for now, just make sure to leverage Key Values early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;networking&quot;&gt;Networking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was traveling, I received an email from a recruiter at Greylock who connects engineers with Greylock‚Äôs portfolio companies. I obviously couldn‚Äôt meet up then, but when I returned, I bumped the thread and we set up time to chat. This relationship would ultimately prove quite fruitful and I encourage you to establish an open communication channel with recruiters at VCs. They‚Äôre wonderful people ‚Äì and everybody loves a good matchmaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I started reaching out to friends who worked at companies that were on my lists. This was admittedly not a very expansive network, and I only knew people who worked at 3 companies on my initial list: Affirm, PagerDuty and Uber. I asked if they would feel comfortable referring me and all three were happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I reached out to friends and asked if they could introduce me to second degree connections. Often, I found that my friends were excited to make introductions if they could. Richard connected me to one of his good friends who worked at BitGo. Another one of my friends couldn‚Äôt introduce me to anyone, but he dogmatically encouraged me to apply to his company: Coffee Meets Bagel (CMB). While I didn‚Äôt get past the recruiter screen at CMB, his referral proved to be highly useful for our next topic: Resume polishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;resumes&quot;&gt;Resumes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm a strong believer in keeping resumes short. I have been part of the resume filtration process before and believe long resumes are a disservice to those who must read them. Respect other people‚Äôs time!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wHtmSZ4JgV3WiZtjv5uyxc0z6qOtIVVM/view?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;the resume I used for my job search here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one evening, I summed up my 3 years of professional experience into 4 or 5 bullet points. On another evening, I wrote descriptions for recent hackathon projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sent my resume out for comments. Unsurprisingly, those who gave me the best comments were friends referring me to their own companies. My friend at CMB helped me eliminate vague bullet points. My friend at Uber gave me tactical advice: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt list a technology on your resume unless you‚Äôre willing to be grilled on it‚Äù. So true. Don‚Äôt give your interviewer a chance to put you on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, I copied the updates from my resume into LinkedIn. And I marked that I was no longer at my previous job (it had been recommended to me to initially show that I was still at my previous company following the layoff, but it was time to rip off that band-aid).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mindset for updating my resume was MVP. Honestly, resumes only serve two purposes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get you noticed by recruiters for the job you want&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A conversation starter for every interview&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does your resume perform those two jobs? Great. Is it as simple as possible? Great. Now ship it. There are more important things to focus on. If you want any resume help, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pliao39&quot;&gt;connect with me&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, I got a friend to take a new photo of me (via my iPhone). I‚Äôve started using it everywhere, on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/pliao39&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pliao39&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and on this website. (PS If anyone out there knows someone who shoots great headshots, hit me up, I‚Äôm on the market for a new one)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;fortune-favors&quot;&gt;Fortune Favors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶the unprepared? On January 30, I had been back in SF for 6 jetlagged days. On that day, I was collecting information on the Triplebyte interview process. Specifically, I was looking to answer the question: If I failed the Triplebyte quiz, could I try again? (The answer appears to be&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6y4ekx/can_i_retake_the_triplebyte_quiz/?st=jgbdyg8r&amp;amp;sh=d5a5d321&quot;&gt; yes, but after 4 months&lt;/a&gt;). But suddenly, I felt a compulsion to ignore Richard‚Äôs advice and jump into the quiz ‚Äì preparation be damned. My heart rate rose. I gazed at the start button. I clicked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first 3 or so questions surprised me ‚Äì I couldn‚Äôt answer them! I had to select ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù. I felt twinges of panic. And regret. I should have prepared! How is this quiz so hard! But I stayed the course. I answered another question and then another. Eventually, the questions fell in my wheelhouse. I got on a roll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later (I don‚Äôt remember when), I got an Intercom message on Triplebyte‚Äôs site: ‚ÄúCongrats on doing very well on the quiz! The next step is a technical interview with us.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow, okay. Hurdle cleared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;weeks-3-6-the-grind&quot;&gt;Weeks 3-6: The Grind&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;pep-talk&quot;&gt;Pep Talk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to take a moment to talk about how the job search process can completely shake your self confidence. You know what you‚Äôre capable of. You know what you‚Äôve done in the past. In fact, no one in the world knows your ability better than you do (although &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/03/you-dont-know-yourself-as-well-as-you-think-you-do/554612/&quot;&gt;collectively, your co-workers probably do&lt;/a&gt;, but that‚Äôs collectively). Yet, here you are, being evaluated and tested. All of your past accomplishments are invalidated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sucks. Doing something you haven‚Äôt done in a long time (interviewing) and getting judged on your ability to do that thing can mess with your head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might start avoiding companies that you suspect will reject you (this is what I was subconsciously doing at first). You might lose motivation, stop studying and cease applying altogether. You might be led to feel incompetent, unintelligent and unemployable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my friends texted me: ‚ÄúHow do you stay positive?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt haha‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to this feeling, I started to question the usefulness of interviews and their ability to detect my value. For a while, I stopped preparing for interviews and pursued other interests (for me, I studied other things: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptozombies.io/&quot;&gt;CryptoZombies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://hpbn.co/&quot;&gt;High Performance Browser Networking&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are great resources, btw. Of course, I procrastinated with the usual suspects as well: watching sports, reading random articles on the internet).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many smart people have abandoned the idea of getting a traditional job and have sidestepped the interview process altogether by starting their own companies. In one of his recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://steveblank.com/2018/04/11/why-entrepreneurs-start-companies-rather-than-join-them/&quot;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;, Steve Blank analyzes the paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2596846&quot;&gt;Asymmetric Information and Entrepreneurship&lt;/a&gt; and summarizes one of its conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúPeople choose to be entrepreneurs when they feel that they are more capable than what employers can tell from their resume or an interview. So, entrepreneurs start ventures because they can‚Äôt signal their worth to potential employers.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began to feel that way. And on top of that, I met up with a few friends who had struck out on their own and started businesses: &lt;a href=&quot;http://vietcetera.com/&quot;&gt;Vietcetera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://originofmind.clothing/&quot;&gt;Origin of Mind&lt;/a&gt;. With Vietcetera, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/haontran&quot;&gt;Hao&lt;/a&gt; is spotlighting an emerging Vietnam, with a focus on culture and business. The vibe is a bit like The New Yorker, but more entrepreneurial and a whole lot more Vietnamese. With Origin of Mind, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alalafox&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt; is using clothing to spark conversation on some of the country‚Äôs most important social issues. She launched in Oakland with the ‚ÄúOn Education‚Äù collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began to wonder if I should follow in their steps and do something of my own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at the end of the day, I focused on my long game. Yes, my present situation sucks. Yes, this process is uncomfortable. Yes, there might be very intelligent ways to forgo it entirely. But what are my long term goals? What kind of opportunities do I want to be looking at in 10 years time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My long term goals are nebulous. I know it has something to do with community building, entrepreneurship and technology. Only, the shape hasn‚Äôt crystallized yet. And thus, I decided to invest in education. I determined that I would be able to learn the most by working with people who possessed managerial, technical and entrepreneurial skills that I lacked. (And hustling on the side ‚Äì but, that‚Äôs always).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps most significantly, I simply felt this had to be done. The job hunt was something I had been fearful of and as I learned in a meditation class: ‚ÄúWhat we need to do is often what we fear the most‚Äù (Tim Ferris also has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/314018-what-we-fear-doing-most-is-usually-what-we-most&quot;&gt;a variation&lt;/a&gt; of this saying). I can be extremely stubborn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no right answers. Everyone is at a different place and has a different destination in mind. But if your conclusion, like mine, is to continue with your job search, read on, I‚Äôll drop a few tips on how to get through the grind of getting to onsite interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-a-scheduling-tool&quot;&gt;Use a Scheduling Tool&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may waste a lot of time scheduling. Solve the nightmare of double bookings (when two companies book the same time), excessive back and forths, and large blocks of wasted time with a tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com&quot;&gt;Calendly&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://youcanbook.me&quot;&gt;You Can Book Me&lt;/a&gt;. I‚Äôve seen people use &lt;a href=&quot;https://mixmax.com&quot;&gt;Mixmax&lt;/a&gt;, which directly allows people to book a time within an email. They‚Äôre all great tools, and any of them will do. If you find yourself thinking too much about scheduling, use a scheduling tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;connect-with-decision-makers&quot;&gt;Connect with Decision Makers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you can, connect with decision makers. If the CTO reaches out, take the call 100% of the time. If you‚Äôre going to reach out to a company, ask for introductions to decision makers. I find that conversations with decision makers are much more invigorating. Instead of sizing you up, wondering if you will pass their technical challenges, decision makers are thinking about fit. They spend the phone call trying to probe if you‚Äôll be excellent on their team. This will be a great way to break up the monotony of talking to recruiters. (And anecdotally, converts much better too!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, I believe there is a way to conduct a job search that revolves entirely around connecting with decision makers ‚Äì instead of a numbers game, it‚Äôs all about developing mutual trust with a small number of people who are looking to stack their teams with absurdly strong talent. But, that‚Äôs an entirely different approach from the one I conducted and a discussion for a different time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-screens&quot;&gt;My Screens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, weeks 3 ‚Äì 6 were dominated by phone screens and take homes. This section of my job search was a grind. I spent a large percentage of my time waiting for phone calls. I tried to utilize that time to study, but was very inefficient. Nonetheless, I did the bulk of my studying during these weeks. On some days I did one or two Leetcode problems (it‚Äôs okay if you fail lots of questions and need to look at the answer after 25 minutes. I did this a lot. Just try to find a similar question and use what you learned). On other days, I worked on problems from Cracking the Coding Interview. On other days, I read sections from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Eastern-Economy-Thomas/dp/8120340078/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1524621154&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=clrs+algorithms&quot;&gt;CLRS Algorithms book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some reason, interviewers love to ask questions that involve BFS/DFS (as Richard foretold), tree traversals, and 2 pointer problems. The last category is nebulous, but is a very useful tool in your toolbox. It involves using two (or more) pointers in crafty ways (maybe you have one pointer start at the beginning of a sorted array and another at the end, maybe you have two sorted lists and use a pointer for each‚Ä¶). If you have identified a brute force solution that requires O(n^2) comparisons, this is often a fruitful question: ‚ÄúCan I do better if I use two pointers to get everything done in O(n) time?‚Äù. This was a surprisingly helpful tactic for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another note ‚Äì I loved take homes. As a practicing software engineer, I found that take home assignments gave me a chance to send a true signal about my abilities. They weren‚Äôt algorithm heavy, but tested my ability to write non trivial, production-level code. Affirm provided the option of either a take home or a technical phone screen. I gladly took the take home ‚Äì not only did I get a chance to write code that simulated real work, I learned some useful domain knowledge that helped me understand their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this grind, I also experienced rejection. At the recruiter screen, I was rejected by Crew and CMB. At the technical phone screen, I was rejected by Pinterest and Blend. Blend in particular hurt, I had gotten excited about the idea that Blend would be a good fit. But as Richard advised me at the very beginning, get used to rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, rejection is a good thing. It means you have pushed yourself to your current boundaries. Furthermore, it toughens you for future encounters, improving your ability to stay calm under pressure. Getting rejected by Pinterest and Blend also made me a little better at technical questions (I implemented improved solutions to the problems immediately after the screens).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don‚Äôt worry, the rejections didn‚Äôt stop there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;weeks-7-10-onsites-and-offers&quot;&gt;Weeks 7-10: Onsites and Offers&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;week-7&quot;&gt;Week 7&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of my phone screens and take homes started to convert and suddenly, it was onsite season. My first two onsites were with Sonder and Google. I failed both. Interestingly, they were polar opposites. Sonder asked 0 algorithm questions, focusing entirely on system design and object oriented programming. Googled asked 5 algorithm/cleverness questions. I was completely stumped by one of the questions and spent most of the 45 minute session trying to keep a level head. I walked out of the interview embarrassed. I refer to this interview as The Disaster. (The other 4 were ok).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went home to Texas for 5 days (Thursday through Monday) after my Google interview. Taking a planned vacation in the middle of onsite season was incredibly important. It gave me a chance to integrate the lessons of failure, as well as a chance to relax and get ready for the next wave of onsites. I highly recommend a period of rest if you can make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;week-8&quot;&gt;Week 8&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following week, I had onsites with Intercom, b8ta and Solv. With the scars from my recent failures, I walked into those onsites with confidence. At both b8ta and Solv, one of my interviews centered around CSS, which I bombed. But unlike The Disaster at Google, I did not panic, not even a little. I stayed calm, openly told my interviewers that CSS was the weakest of my full stack skills and we proceeded to have a surprisingly not-awkward session of me DuckDuckGo-ing basic CSS. I was rejected by b8ta and Solv. In their email to me, Solv told me this: ‚ÄúWhile everyone appreciated your personality, communication and problem solving, tech thinking, we hit a road block on the core front end skills..‚Äù Haha, fair enough!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Intercom called me to let me know they were extending an offer! Everything changes when you get your first offer. Your belief in yourself is finally re-validated. Just as importantly, other companies will pick up the pace and get with your timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;week-9&quot;&gt;Week 9&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next week, I had onsites with Earnin, Affirm and Uber. At this point, the onsites felt routine. Once in a while, I felt that my interviewers were really testing me, pushing the envelope to see how I would react. I clearly communicated what I completely didn‚Äôt know and stretched to hit the questions I thought I could get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnin and Uber extended offers. Affirm would not get back to me until the following week with a soft rejection: the team I had interviewed with would not be moving forward, but they could reconsider me for a different team. I accepted the rejection and declined to move forward with the other team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, the length of time a company takes to get back to you after the onsite is incredibly revealing. If it‚Äôs in 1 or 2 days, the result was either a clear yes or clear no. This is ideal. If it‚Äôs longer than 3 days, then the result was either contentious or the company doesn‚Äôt operate efficiently. Neither of those are good things. You want to go to a team that wants you, not a team that is settling for you. And you definitely don‚Äôt want to go to team that doesn‚Äôt respect candidates‚Äô time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;week-10&quot;&gt;Week 10&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my final week, I managed to squeeze in one last company into the mix. I had alluded to BitGo earlier in my blog post, but what I did not share was that I had actually designed my entire interview process with them in mind. I shared this with Richard one day. I had been reading High Performance Browser Networking and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Belshe&quot;&gt;Mike Belshe&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of BitGo, kept popping up in the book. While at Google, he had masterminded the SPDY specification which laid the foundation for HTTP 2.0. I had been reading some Bitcoin blogs and &lt;a href=&quot;https://lopp.net/&quot;&gt;Jameson Lopp&lt;/a&gt;, a BitGo engineer, kept popping up. (Jameson has since left, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lopp/status/969567040401965056&quot;&gt;but on great terms&lt;/a&gt;). I wanted to be in the Crypto space and BitGo was the one company I really had strong interest in joining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard had a good friend at BitGo who referred me. The company sent me a HackerRank coding challenge. I did it (although one of my solutions didn‚Äôt pass all tests). I didn‚Äôt hear back for a while, assuming that I had been screened out. Then, out of the blue, I got a message from BitGo in week 9 ‚Äì they wanted to set up a technical phone screen. We squeezed in the phone screen on Friday of week 9 and my onsite was on Monday of week 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought the BitGo onsite was solid, despite it being my 7th onsite in 13 days. My solutions weren‚Äôt as sharp as they could have been, but they weren‚Äôt bad. In my tired state, I tried to communicate my strong interest in BitGo. They asked for references and I waited for them to check in with some of my former coworkers. 4 days later, I got a call from BitGo letting me know that they would not be matching my other offers and would not extend one of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve heard this time and time again. The more you want to work at a company, the more desperate you come off, and the less desirable of a candidate you become. This is by no means a deal breaker for companies, but you should avoid doing what I did. Don‚Äôt design your process around one company. The chances are, they won‚Äôt reciprocate and might even read your enthusiasm as uncomfortable desperation. Just keep an open mind, your best opportunity might not even be one you were hoping to get. It‚Äôs sort of like Frank Ocean said/sang: ‚ÄúThe best song wasn‚Äôt the single‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a related note, an hour after I heard back from BitGo, I spoke with a Director of Engineering at Uber (my manager‚Äôs manager). I was sold. On March 30, 2018 at 2PM I contacted Intercom, Earnin and Uber and communicated my decision. It had been 65 days since I touched down in SFO. The job search had finally ended. I was Uber bound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;lessons&quot;&gt;Lessons&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a few takeaways from my job search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act&lt;/strong&gt; before you feel ready&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you feel 40% ready? Great! You‚Äôre more than ready to get out there&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always be &lt;strong&gt;networking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even when you‚Äôre job searching, form new connections! But never ask new connections for help. Always have the mentality of being a valuable addition to people‚Äôs network.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leverage your close connections for introductions to companies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask your close connections for referrals (there‚Äôs usually a referral bonus anyways)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Respect other people‚Äôs &lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt; (but especially, your own!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Concise resumes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@Torbahax/how-to-write-emails-like-a-ceo-d6a2906611e0&quot;&gt;Concise emails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use a scheduler (like Calendly, You Can Book Me, Mixmax or some competitor)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Study in &lt;strong&gt;manageable&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;bits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spend 25 minutes on a problem and if you‚Äôre going nowhere, peek at the solution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don‚Äôt try to cram multiple topics in a day. For example, I took one evening to understand min/max heaps. Nothing more. It was one of my most productive study sessions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don‚Äôt get tunnel vision. Have a mentality of &lt;strong&gt;abundance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;‚ÄúThe best song wasn‚Äôt the single‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tons of excellent companies out there. If you get rejected from one that you particularly like, don‚Äôt sweat it. There will be more. Always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Embrace &lt;strong&gt;failure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Failure sucks! But each failure is an asset. It‚Äôs like fertilizer for growth. So long as you are putting in effort, failure will accelerate your progress like nothing else. Getting used to it will give you an edge&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being laid off doesn‚Äôt matter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The pain from being laid off will heal with time and as you talk more openly about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While it might be a sore topic for you, most people will not prod. They might be curious as to what happened, but a simple tautology or circular definition is almost always enough to appease their curiosity: ‚ÄúThe company didn‚Äôt meet its financial aspirations and elected to downsize. I was affected‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let me know if you want to talk more about it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs going to suck! Putting yourself out there for assessment and evaluation is a vulnerable experience. It‚Äôs not pleasant. And if you‚Äôre like me, you probably won‚Äôt enjoy it. But deep down, you‚Äôll know whether or not this process is something you must do. For me, I felt that I had to do this. I felt compelled to push through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you ever need someone to rely on, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pliao39&quot;&gt;come find me&lt;/a&gt;. So long as I‚Äôm not inundated with projects, I will make time for you. I believe we all need a strong support network in difficult times and I‚Äôd be thrilled to become a node in your network!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;In two weeks, I‚Äôll be writing about my first job search. It‚Äôs a story of how an unemployed Economics major hustled his way into the software world. I‚Äôll share some of my cold emails and tips to break in. Sign up for my mailing list and don‚Äôt miss it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[mc4wp_form id=‚Äù28‚Ä≥]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;appendix-recommended-companies&quot;&gt;Appendix: Recommended Companies&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my job search, I applied to 18 companies and talked with 13. There lots of great things to say about each, but I want to highlight a few that I‚Äôm extra excited about. These are companies that I would strongly recommend to friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;intercom&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intercom.com/careers&quot;&gt;Intercom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm really excited about Intercom both as a business and as a place to work. Intercom‚Äôs engineering values of ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.intercom.com/run-less-software&quot;&gt;Run less software&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù and ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.intercom.com/shipping-is-your-companys-heartbeat/&quot;&gt;Shipping is your company‚Äôs heartbeat&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù really resonated with me. As someone who has been heavily influenced by the book &lt;em&gt;The Pragmatic Programmer&lt;/em&gt;, Intercom‚Äôs engineering culture felt incredibly efficient. Jamming with the team on a hackathon-like project was energizing and fun. The team is entrepreneurial and pragmatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone who loves building excellent product, I would strongly advise Intercom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;solv&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.solvhealth.com/careers&quot;&gt;Solv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My phone call with Daniele (CTO and co-founder at Solv) was one of the highlights of my job search. We talked about life, healthcare, Bill Gurley, prioritization and my work style. I left the call feeling incredibly excited. The onsite with Solv was great, but unfortunately, my CSS deficiencies were a deal breaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre interested in healthcare, like working with smart and passionate people, then you have to check out Solv. (You should also read the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Catastrophic-Care-Everything-Think-Health/dp/034580273X&quot;&gt;Catastrophic Care&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;earnin&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.earnin.com/Careers&quot;&gt;Earnin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I went onsite at Earnin, I was impressed with their engineering culture. Interviews felt collaborative, the assessments were diverse (system design, algorithm, short answer, object oriented design), and the people were down to earth. The more junior engineers talked about how they felt supported by the senior engineers, and the more senior engineers mentioned how they liked mentoring. This all happened without any top down directives with regards to mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre looking for a strong group of engineers who have built a great organic culture, I believe you‚Äôll find it at Earnin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;triplebyte&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://triplebyte.com&quot;&gt;Triplebyte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I didn‚Äôt interview for a position at Triplebyte, but I worked with them. Of all my 44 technical assessments, the Triplebyte interview was the most fun and engaging. My talent manager was enthusiastic and genuinely wanted to place me at a great company. The only thing about Triplebyte that is a bit hit or miss is their matching process (a bit opaque and not always successful). Still, it is absolutely worth your time to work with Triplebyte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I would have paid just to take their assessment and ‚Äúget Triplebyte certified‚Äù. That would be a nice feature for those with non-traditional backgrounds to signal that they‚Äôve been vetted by at least one 3rd party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try out their &lt;a href=&quot;https://quiz.triplebyte.com/&quot;&gt;practice quiz&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äì it‚Äôs actually kind of hard (I learned a couple things even from this practice quiz!). Read their &lt;a href=&quot;https://triplebyte.com/blog&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs excellent. And if you‚Äôre curious about salaries, check out their &lt;a href=&quot;https://triplebyte.com/software-engineer-salary&quot;&gt;aggregated salary visualizations&lt;/a&gt;. I don‚Äôt talk about salary in this post, but I will comment that those graphs were in line with my offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;appendix-critical-resources&quot;&gt;Appendix: Critical Resources&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-values&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.keyvalues.com/&quot;&gt;Key Values&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mentioned it earlier, but I want to reiterate ‚Äì Key Values is the closest thing to a company‚Äôs culture resume anywhere on the internet. Companies get to talk about what they think is important and highlight their cultural strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, browsing Key Values will reaffirm your beliefs in your own cultural values. This is incredibly important to be thinking about throughout your job search. While Key Values may not have the company profile that you‚Äôre looking for, it will categorically make your job search better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do yourself a favor and use Key Values from the start. And check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.keyvalues.com/culture-queries&quot;&gt;culture queries&lt;/a&gt;, it will get your mind thinking about the important things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;angellist&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://angel.co/&quot;&gt;AngelList&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;AngelList is a fantastic resource to get in contact with startups. I know so many people who have gotten jobs through AngelList, and in fact, it was how I got my first job. One thing to be aware of is that on AngelList, a company can see the number of companies a candidate has indicated interest in. Don‚Äôt be the person who is ‚Äúinterested‚Äù in 723 companies. Be selective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;glassdoor&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/index.htm&quot;&gt;Glassdoor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let it be known that I believe Glassdoor is the Yelp of company culture reviews. It‚Äôs heavily influenced by disgruntled employees and coordinated manipulation (I stumbled upon a well known company with over 40 reviews, the majority of which were generic 5 star reviews published within a 7 day span). The product is occasionally unusable (because they constantly direct you to use their job search product). But it has some great authentic reviews. And it‚Äôs not going anywhere because of its strong network effects. Ultimately, those brief moments of authenticity are worth the noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love and hate Glassdoor.&lt;/p&gt;</content></item></channel></rss>
