Basis Cash is growing by millions of BAC every 24 hours, quintupling its market cap this week.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/stablecoins/market-cap-go-up.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"market cap go up\"></figure><p>Unlike DAI or USDC, Empty Set Dollar (ESD) and Basis Cash (BAC) have no collateral that backs their value. They are entirely algorithmic. This is how they work:</p><ul><li>When the price is greater than $1: brrrr (print money)</li><li>When the price is less than $1: issue \"Seigniorage Shares\". </li></ul><p>A seigniorage share basically says \"if you destroy your money, we'll issue you a coupon for preferential treatment when we print more\" - in other words, you destroy some tokens now and get more tokens in the future.</p><p>These are both young projects and it's exciting times.</p><p>But what's somewhat alarming is that these coins have been off their peg quite a bit this week (black line indicates $1):</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/stablecoins/stablecoin-instability.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"stablecoins not stable\"></figure><p>Yes, they're both new and over time, I have some level of confidence that they'll return to their $1 peg, but there are still questions that give me pause.</p><h3 id=\"return-of-the-apes\">Return of the Apes</h3><p>Liquidity mining for Empty Set Dollar has attracted the apes. The surge in price of ESD (remember, it's a stablecoin) is almost entirely attributable to the ridiculous yields: </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/stablecoins/degen-farming-esd.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"degen esd farming\"></figure><p>DeFi summer like yields are back. This time, brought to you by ESD. </p><p>But the crazy thing is this isn't a liquidity mining incentive. This is just how ESD works. Right now, because ESD is above the $1 peg, the algorithm is choosing to expand supply. It does so by rewarding those ESD holders who have bonded their ESD to the DAO, or have bonded their ESD/USDC LP Tokens  to the protocol.</p><p>This is a strange. Consider the following incentives that exist when ESD is above $1:</p><ul><li>an incentive to buy ESD and bond it (to capture some of the expanding supply)</li><li>(for existing holders) an incentive to bond your ESD to the DAO (to capture some of the expanding supply)</li><li>(for existing holders) an incentive to sell your ESD for another stablecoin (to arbitrage)</li></ul><p>There are incentives to move the price of ESD in both directions.</p><p>ESD can only be stable when the incentive to sell outweighs the incentive to buy. This is a super strange for a stablecoin and I suspect these competing incentives will lead ESD to have extended episodes above $1 in the future. </p><p>With degenerate casino yield farmers constantly looking for insane APYs and coordinating themselves in Discords, you might even get some reflexivity that drives the price upwards from time to time.</p><p>I have a lot of questions about ESD issuance in such a world, but one must hope that cooler heads will prevail and arbitrage ESD back to its peg.</p><h3 id=\"fairness\">Fairness</h3><p>At the core of both of these stablecoins is an issuance model that benefits certain individuals at the expense of others.</p><p>ESD benefits those who have \"bonded\" their ESD.</p><p>BAC benefits those who own a complimentary token BAS (all new issuance goes to BAS hoders).</p><p>This is unlike Ampleforth which changes everyone's balance daily. This doesn't benefit or harm anyone (i.e. the Cantillon Effect).</p><p>I don't have any hypotheses on how the \"fairness\" of a stablecoin will affect the demand for it. Are all stablecoins viewed as equals? Will people want Ampleforth more because it distributes (and contracts) its supply more fairly?</p><h3 id=\"collapse\">Collapse</h3><p>An algorithmic stablecoin like ESD and BAC are only stable if they can retain their peg. But what happens if the price falls below $1 and not enough people believe that there will be future issuance?</p><p>If that ever happens, then the price of ESD and BAC could never return to their peg, and confidence in these assets would fall. As more people lose confidence, we get reflexivity in the downwards direction as a falling price leads to a greater collapse in confidence, which leads to more dumping. </p><p>This would result in a collapse in the value of ESD or BAC. Will one of these be the first stablecoins to fail? Can the psuedonymous teams behind these projects come up with a strategy to mitigate this potential nightmare?</p><p>Early hopes are that ESD V2 could potentially dampen these effects with the <a href=\"https://medium.com/emptysetdollar/introducing-the-esd-treasury-7fe116306c77\">introduction of a treasury</a>. This would transform ESD from a pure algorithmic stablecoin into a hybrid algorithmic, collateral backed stablecoin. ESD could become a multipler on top of other stablecoins, drastically expanding supply while offering greater price stability through the aribitraging actions of the treasury.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>I'm watching this space with caution. The demand for stablecoins is massive, and algorithmic stablecoins could potentially scale to supply that demand.</p><p>But they aren't without flaws. They could potentially go to $0. Or they could fulfill their vision and bring a programmable medium of exchange to the masses.</p><p>Only time will tell.</p><p>Some links for further reading:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/basis-cash/overall-guide-for-basis-cash-79b606c5ba8c\">Basis Cash Overview</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.emptyset.finance/\">Empty Set Dollar docs</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-8yjmsshFg\">Ampleforth Explainer</a> </li><li><a href=\"https://haseebq.com/stablecoins-designing-a-price-stable-cryptocurrency/\">Haseeb's Primer on Stablecoin design</a></li><li><a href=\"https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stability-elasticity-and-reflexivity-a-deep-dive-into-algorithmic-stablecoins/\">Deribit's Deep Dive into Algorithmic Stablecoins</a></li></ul>","comment_id":"5fd64c654a5ff40cd092573b","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fG1vbmV5JTIwcHJpbnR8ZW58MHx8fA&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=2000","featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-12-13T17:16:21.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-12-21T16:54:54.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-12-20T06:23:51.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"Algorithmic stablecoins are here and they're expanding their supply.

First, there is an underlying trend that is rooted in reality, and second, a misconception that is correlated to the trend, but wrong. The trend and the misconception reinforce each other, leading to the bubble. But, the music must stop, and when it does, the trend and misconception reinforce each other, but in reverse.

This section exists to catalogue my struggles as well as record key \"takeaways\" such that I remember the high level strategies that help.</p><p><strong>3Sum</strong> - this problem was painful for me. The optimal solution is so simple once you understand it, but I had to try a couple attempts at this (3 days in a row, after looking at a very well commented solution)</p><p>Takeaways: sorting, two pointers (converging from the left and right onto something in the middle) </p><p><strong>Search in Rotated Sorted Array</strong> - binary search! My solution didn't match the solutions of others, but was fairly elegant.  A friend of mine said that \"you need to be able to write binary search on a whim\" for interviews. I think that's absolutely true.</p><p>Takeaways: practice implementing binary search every now and then. There are a few gotchas that can trip up an algorithm (i.e. lots of off by one errors).</p><p><strong>Combination Sum</strong> - backtracking! I had never implemented a backtracking algorithm before, but after seeing a few examples, I got the hang of it. The Leetcode discussions have a <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/discuss/16502/A-general-approach-to-backtracking-questions-in-Java-(Subsets-Permutations-Combination-Sum-Palindrome-Partitioning)\">very good generalized way</a> of attacking backtracking problems. It makes sense that there is a collection and you \"add\", try an operation, then \"remove\"  (which aids in the name of backtracking), but this offends my functional programming sensibilities.</p><p>Takeaways: when you need to find ALL solutions to a problem, there's a decent chance backtracking can help. As Abdul Bari says, if you need to find an optimal solution, there's a chance dynamic programming is your friend.</p><p><strong>Valid Binary Search Tree</strong> - I feel like I've encountered this problem in interviews before. For some reason, I always reach for a recursive solution (which works just fine), but it's useful to remember the in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals. Here's a <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/discuss/32112/Learn-one-iterative-inorder-traversal-apply-it-to-multiple-tree-questions-(Java-Solution)\">great discussion link</a> about in-order traversal and how it can also be used to find the \"k-th smallest\" item in a binary search tree (also a problem I feel like I've encountered).</p><p>Takeaways: Practice in-order traversal</p><p><strong>Number of Islands</strong> - Ah, hello my old friend. I remember when I first attempted this, I spent over 2 hours and I couldn't solve it. Now, I can whip up a pretty tasty solution in 20 minutes. This go around, I forgot a couple of small insights. Reminder: <strong>iterate</strong> through the map (double for loop) in search for an island, do <strong>BFS</strong> once you hit an island <strong>mutating the island with breadcrumbs</strong> as you go, and make sure you count properly.</p><p>Takeaways: remember that BFS is for search, not necessarily for performance.</p><h2 id=\"abdul-bari-youtube-notes\">Abdul Bari YouTube Notes</h2><p>These are notes from watching Abdul Bari's video lectures.</p><h3 id=\"prim-s-and-kruskal-s-algorithms-minimum-spanning-trees-\">Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithms (Minimum Spanning Trees)</h3><p>While reviewing The Algorithm Design Manual, I realized I had never really attempted a solution at the Traveling Salesman Problem. This took me down a rabbit hole of reading about Minimum Spanning Trees, and later, UnionFind (aka the DisjointSets data structure).</p><p>Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms are ways to generate Minimum Spanning Trees.</p><p>The key thing to remember here are both of these algos are <strong>greedy</strong>. That is, they start with the smallest edge, and go from there.</p><ul><li>Prim: start w/smallest edge, find next smallest connected edge that doesn't form a cycle, and continue</li><li>Kruskal: start w/smallest edge, find next smallest (can be unconnected from the first) that doesn't form a cycle, and continue</li></ul><p>Prim is O(n^2) and Kruskal is O(m logm) where n is the number of vertices in the graph, and m is the number of edges.</p><h3 id=\"unionfind-aka-disjointsets-\">UnionFind (aka DisjointSets)</h3><p>This data structure is extremely useful for Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms becuase both rely on cycle detection. </p><p>The UnionFind data structure is excellent at helping us detect cycles.</p><p>UnionFind can be most efficiently implemented as an array (which in my opinion is difficult to understand). However, at it's core, it is a collection of Sets of vertices: Collection&lt;Set&lt;Vertex&gt;&gt;</p><p>It's hard to explain in words, but here's my best shot:</p><ul><li>Build up UnionFind/DisjointSets by adding edges to the collection of disjoint sets</li><li>When an edge is added, one of 4 possibilities may occur</li><li>1) The edge is disjoint from all existing sets. Add a new disjoint set to the collection</li><li>2) The edge is connected to one of the sets. \"Enlarge\" the set.</li><li>3) The edge joins two disjoint sets together. Perform a union of those two sets (make sure to delete the previously disjoint sets from the collection)</li><li>4) The edge is already \"spanned\" by one of the sets. In this case, we do nothing. However, in the case of Prim's and Kruskal's - this condition triggers our <strong>cycle detected</strong> mechanism.</li></ul><h3 id=\"np-problems\">NP Problems</h3><p>I've never understood all the stuff about P and NP. After watching Abdul, I'm still a little confused, but I think it's a little more clear. These don't really come up in interviews, but it's useful to recognize if an interviewer presents a problem that is NP.</p><p>Polynomial time: n, logn, n<sup>2</sup>, nlogn, n<sup>3</sup></p><p>Not polynomial time: 2<sup>n</sup>, n!</p><p>Even n<sup>10</sup> is much smaller for 2<sup>n</sup> for somewhat sizeable values of n.</p><p>NP stands for non-deterministic polynomial.

Today, I routinely average 100+ WPM on TypeRacer and recorded a 111 WPM mark on 10 Fast Fingers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/how-to-type-faster/httf-100wpm.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshots of my typing results\"></figure><p>Every email I write is now easier. Every blog post I write is more effortless. As a developer, I don't program that much faster, but the cost of implementation feels cheaper. As a result, I write better emails, publish more blog posts, and finish more software projects. Everything just feels slightly easier than before.</p><p>Typing faster has tremendous benefits. </p><p>Don't listen to anyone who types slower than 80 WPM and says speed doesn't matter. \"You're bottle-necked by your thinking speed, not your typing speed\" is something someone says to rationalize staying at 65 WPM.</p><p>If you're committed to becoming more productive, improving your typing speed is a killer investment.</p><h3 id=\"a-note-on-measuring-wpm\">A note on measuring WPM</h3><p>Before we talk about how to reach 100+ WPM, I need to discuss what we mean by \"100 WPM\".</p><p>I have watched a few YouTube videos that claim that you can reach 100+ WPM from 40 WPM in a single week. That's ridiculous. This takes a lot of effort, and I have the data to back it up.</p><p>The problem with these claims is that they're measuring a personal best, not an average.</p><p>If you look at someone's TypeRacer results on a graph, you'll notice a ton of variance.  Here is a graph of all of my races - the goal is to get consistently above the 100 WPM line:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/how-to-type-faster/httf-above-the-line.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Get consistently above 100 WPM\"></figure><p>I recorded a few 100+ WPM races early on! (The first appearance of a 100+ WPM race was #604). But that didn't mean I was typing at an average of 100+ WPM. It wasn't until very recently that I was consistently hitting over 100 WPM.</p><p>As a proxy for this, we can take the average of our recent races. TypeRacer itself shows you a widget that tracks your trailing 10 races, which is solid metric.</p><p>When I say \"type 100 WPM\", I mean that we're consistently recording 100+ WPM on the TypeRacer widget.</p><p>Ok, now that we've clarified what 100 WPM means, here are the steps I took to type faster.</p><h2 id=\"fundamentals\">Fundamentals</h2><p>Before you can type faster, you need to master the fundamentals of touch typing - or typing accurately without looking down on your fingers. </p><p>If you're typing under 50WPM, it likely means you're still looking at the keyboard and haven't gotten proper finger placement. Don't stress too much on getting textbook finger placement (everyone tweaks their finger placement over time anyways), but start by following the textbook approach.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/how-to-type-faster/httf-placement.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"How to place your fingers for typing\"></figure><p>To practice proper placement and eliminate looking at your keyboard, go to a website like <a href=\"https://www.typing.com/\">typing.com</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.keybr.com/\">keybr.com</a>. Typing.com will teach you proper finger placement. Keybr will help you practice to eliminate errors. </p><p>Depending on where you're starting, you might need to spend a month or so here. Typing.com might be boring, but <strong>don't skip this step</strong>. Keybr is optional, but I recommend spending some time to clean up mistakes. </p><p>Speed doesn't matter until you're touch typing. And there's a good chance that your speed will naturally rise to around 60 WPM when you get the fundamentals of touch typing down.</p><p>This is the least fun step, but nothing else matters if you skip it. (That said, you can ignore numbers for now)</p><h2 id=\"speed-drills\">Speed Drills</h2><p>Now that you've mastered the basics of typing without looking at the keyboard, it's time to focus on speed.</p><p>While our goal is to record a sustained 10 race average of 100+ on TypeRacer, I think it's important to dedicate some of your practice to 10 Fast Fingers. </p><p>Here are the features of 10 Fast Fingers:</p><ul><li>Incorrect words do not need to be fixed</li><li>No punctuation</li><li>The 200 word bank has a lot of common words which you'll probably be typing a lot</li><li>60 second interval guaranteed </li></ul><p>This lends itself to building up raw speed.</p><p>I know a lot of advice out there talks about minimizing mistakes, which is absolutely crucial for typing faster. However, you need to improve your raw speed too. And 10 Fast Fingers is the best drill I have found for this.</p><p>Whenever I practice typing, I start on 10 Fast Fingers for about 5-10 minutes, and then transition to TypeRacer. This vastly improves my practice sessions.</p><h2 id=\"practice-on-typeracer\">Practice on TypeRacer</h2><p>10 Fast Fingers is great, but it's not a true measurement of your speed like TypeRacer. TypeRacer is the standardized test that we're aiming to ace.</p><p>I spend the vast majority of my typing practice on TypeRacer. There's not a whole lot to be said other than do a ton of races. </p><p>But I want to share some advice:</p><ul><li>Join <strong>competitive races</strong> ASAP. Doing practice races feels \"safer\" but those results aren't tracked so they're pretty much useless. Nothing bad happens if you lose a race!</li><li>You will <strong>not improve monotonically</strong>. That is to say, you will experience lots of spikes and regressions in your typing speed. This is normal and don't beat yourself up about it</li><li>Your <strong>sleep and drowsiness</strong> play a large role in your typing speed  </li><li>You will get better at <strong>punctuation</strong> with practice</li><li>You will get really good at hitting <strong>backspace</strong></li><li>You will not get better at <strong>numbers</strong> unless you practice them deliberately. I suggest you learn the placement of a couple numbers (1, 9, and 0 are good ones to start)</li><li><strong>Capitalization</strong> is still a huge pain, I still have trouble with capitalization</li><li>You will notice that <strong>not all passages are created equal</strong>. Some are way harder and will torpedo your typing speed. It's okay, that happens.</li><li>You will read some <strong>extremely interesting quotes.</strong> I've bought books just because of passages I've encountered on TypeRacer. I've stopped and listened to songs on Spotify because of it too.</li><li>You should <strong>visualize your progress</strong>. It's extremely motivating to see your progress on a chart. I've <a href=\"https://philipliao.com/projects/typeracer\">built a tool</a> to visualize my own progress. I'm planning to add the ability for anyone to type in their username and see their progress too. There's also a website called <a href=\"http://typeracerdata.com\">TypeRacer Data</a> that pulls in detailed statistics about your races (no visualizations though)</li></ul><p>TypeRacer's UI basically lets you get into a flow state of races. Do a race, and then another, and another. It's extremely conducive to practice, and I find it quite fun.</p><h2 id=\"how-long-will-this-take\">How Long Will This Take?</h2><p>It's taken me about 5000 races on TypeRacer to reach a fairly consistent 100+ WPM. That was spread out over 2 years, and some months I practiced way more than other months.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://philipliao.com/typeracer-4000\">previous article</a>, I mentioned that it took me on average 3 hours of practice to improve my WPM by 1. </p><p>Of course, if you look at my progress chart, you will see something that looks a little more like a step function than a linear graph. </p><p>Since that article, I started mixing in 10 Fast Fingers in my practice. I think mixing in speed drills has helped tremendously, and is largely responsible for my recent surge from the 92-94 WPM range and into the 96-100 WPM range.</p><p>If you are starting at a typing speed of under 80 WPM, I think you will see rapid progress by just fixing your finger placement, getting familiar with touch typing (eliminate the need to look at the keyboard), and just practicing a little on TypeRacer. </p><p>After 80 WPM, if you combine TypeRacer with 10 Fast Fingers, you'll be on your road to 100 in no time. I personally wish I had mixed these two techniques sooner instead of only doing TypeRacer.</p><h2 id=\"next-steps\">Next Steps</h2><p>While I haven't reached the next level (which is to get to the 120 WPM mark), I have done some research and I believe the next step is to:</p><ul><li>Master numbers</li><li>Think in terms of words instead of letters (I'm in a hybrid state)</li></ul><p>People who type really fast process information slightly differently. They need to keep a \"buffer\" in their minds of what they're about to type. I find that I am beginning to need this too.</p><p>I don't have any advice on this, but I really enjoyed this YouTube video of someone who types over 160 WPM:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"612\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oOdfefV2R1I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>Typing faster has been a solid boost to my productivity. It shaves a few minutes off tasks here and there, which might not change how much I can get done in a day, but it reduces the cognitive burden of every task I have.</p><p>There's no secret to typing faster. You just have to do it. In my experience, you'll need a few hours of practice just to increase your typing speed by 1 WPM.</p><p>However, you can practice intelligently by:</p><ul><li>Mastering the fundamentals</li><li>Focusing on Raw Speed</li><li>Then, practicing on TypeRacer</li></ul><p>Best of luck out there!</p>","comment_id":"5fccf10d4a5ff40cd09252c8","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591259932860-d1cbc0b81ec1?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDU1fHx8ZW58MHx8fA&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=2000","featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-12-06T14:56:13.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-12-07T18:48:18.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-12-06T17:14:42.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"This is how I learned to type faster (from 65 WPM to 100 WPM).

Other more engaged users were awarded more (for example, those who bought the Uni-socks \"SOCKS\" were given 1,000 UNI).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/uniswap/uniswap-socks.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Rewards for SOCKS holders\"></figure><p>In addition to the warm fuzzies, this was the first time I had felt - <strong>as a user</strong> - that I was being brought into a community via a financial stake. </p><p>For a while now, companies have been offering equity based compensation to employees, but now, we've arrived at <strong>equity based <em>participation</em></strong>.</p><h2 id=\"equity\">Equity</h2><p>Historically, equity has been something that founders get to determine and investors get to buy into.</p><p>Founders then set aside some small number of shares for future employees, as compensation for their labor and time.</p><p>And together, these founders, investors, and employees get to enjoy the upside of the company. The users are left with a good product, but their upside is capped to the benefits of the product. All of the data that they produce, all of the \"learning\" that they contribute to the company - at best they'll get an Amazon gift card for their focus group participation. Most of the time, they get nothing.</p><p>When I worked at Uber, I received UBER shares for my work. Uber drivers, even though they were awarded <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/uber-is-dishing-out-appreciation-awards-up-to-10000-to-let-prolific-drivers-buy-stock/\">a one time bonus</a> at the time of the IPO, did not recieve UBER shares. </p><p>That's unfair.</p><h2 id=\"inequality\">Inequality</h2><p>Our system is fundamentally flawed. </p><p>I'm not going to get into morality, geopolitical conflict, racism, oppression, and other issues that come up when we talk about our financial system. Those are all serious and important. However, for now, let's focus on inequality.</p><p>Profits in our society are an emergent property of monopoly and oligopoly. In a world of perfect competition, there are no profits. In a world of perfect competition, the \"users\" benefit the most because all value is passed on to the consumers in the form of cheaper, better goods.</p><p>Where there are profits, there is wealth accumulation in the hands of a few. This is not necessarily zero sum, and in fact, it's often additive. In an ideal circumstance, if a company builds a tool that provides everyone with a lot of value at a very affordable price, and it captures some profit, then everyone might be better off because of this.</p><p>But the issue is profits tend towards inequality. Those with equity in the system benefit from unbounded upside. On the other hand, users benefit (if they benefit at all) from a product that has a bounded positive impact on their life.</p><p>And what's crazy is that users play a massive role in the success of the company. Users provide feedback, which informs the company on what to do. Users generate data, which the company analyzes and funnels through statistical models to make more decisions.</p><p>Viewed this way, the YC mantra of \"talk to users\" is extractive. Cynically, they might as well say \"perform highly one sided informational extractions with people who you want to transform into addicts\".</p><p>So if users are contributing to the decisions of the company, doesn't it make sense that they should see some of the financial upside? </p><p>There's no reason we can't be creating \"community\" options pools alongside our employee options pools. If only we, as a society, did that - perhaps we'd be able to combat the specter of inequality.</p><p>Well... Uniswap already did that.</p><h2 id=\"uniswap\">Uniswap</h2><p>Crypto has been experimenting with different ways to promote broader community equity and participation for some time now. ICOs were one wave, but it's questionable if that model really works. Airdrops were another attempt, but randomly gifting wallets felt a bit weird as it didn't align incentives.</p><p>Uniswap's token distribution is different.</p><p>For starters, it's the most successful dApp. Unlike the vast majority of crypto products, it's already extremely useful as it allows people to move their crypto from one token to another in a completely decentralized manner. </p><p>Second, the distribution was tied to behavior that aligned with the project's goals. Uniswap didn't reward any random person, it rewarded users.</p><p>Third, the distribution was significant. They didn't just airdrop the equivalent of a Starbucks gift card. This was approximately $1,200 worth of tokens. But most interestingly, these tokens allow users to have a voice and vote on governance decisions. This is what ownership looks like.</p><p>And then, what I love most about it all, is the manner in which Uniswap did it. This is from their official blog post:</p><blockquote>400 UNI are claimable by each address that has ever called the Uniswap v1 or v2 contracts. This includes <strong>~12,000</strong> addresses that have only ever submitted failed transactions — love you guys.</blockquote><p>\"Love you guys\" - has a company ever distributed $1,200 worth of equity to its users and told them that they're loved?</p><p>The Uniswap team really made it feel like this is a project that is meant to be owned by the community. It's like the Green Bay Packers of crypto projects (the Green Bay Packers are an NFL team, but unlike other teams, they're structured as a <a href=\"https://www.packers.com/community/shareholders\">non profit that is publicly owned by fans</a>).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/uniswap/uniswap-packers.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Uniswap and the Green Bay Packers\"></figure><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>The pace of innovation in crypto is amazing. </p><p>The open source nature of projects means copying happens instantly. Bad actors get heavily penalized as the community swarms against them. Failed projects teach everyone what not to do. Every success is shared and copied by all.</p><p>And now, users can get small ownership stakes even if they just tried a product.</p><p>It's a hive mind that's creating a truly participatory financial system. </p><p>Incredible to watch.</p>","comment_id":"5fb940b64a5ff40cd0924e9c","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1539657523674-fbd149b04c13?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-11-21T16:30:46.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-11-22T02:18:11.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-11-22T02:07:08.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"Uniswap shows us what it looks like to reward users with equity","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"tags":[{"id":"5fb7eee64a5ff40cd0924b98","name":"crypto","slug":"crypto","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2368/tag/crypto/"}],"primary_tag":{"id":"5fb7eee64a5ff40cd0924b98","name":"crypto","slug":"crypto","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2368/tag/crypto/"},"url":"http://localhost:2368/uniswap-and-participatory-equity/","excerpt":"Uniswap shows us what it looks like to reward users with equity","reading_time":4,"access":true,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null},"how-to-yield-farm":{"id":"5fb7ee474a5ff40cd0924b93","uuid":"1dd45b2a-9ed4-4f6f-b00c-e0594cf5341a","title":"How to Yield Farm","slug":"how-to-yield-farm","html":"<p>If you’re reading this, you've probably heard of a craze that took the crypto world earlier this year: \"DeFi Casino Summer\".</p><p>At the center of it all was the introduction of \"yield farming\", a practice that was generating 1000+% APYs at its height.</p><p>In this article, I explain what yield farming is, how to do it, and what the risks are.

Acquire Ether</h3><p>If you've never bought Ether, this is you first hurdle. Thankfully, if you have access to Coinbase, it's pretty easy. That said, it may take DAYS for the ACH transfer from your bank, so you could get stuck at this step if this is the first time you're doing it.</p><p>The second thing to note is that Coinbase charges a hefty 3% fee for buying crypto from their primary website.</p><p>If you find that fee intolerable (you should), then use <a href=\"https://pro.coinbase.com\">Coinbase Pro</a> instead. The Pro version has <a href=\"https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/trading-and-funding/trading-rules-and-fees/fees\">minimal fees</a> (0.50% or less). The user interface may look intimidating, but if you beeline to trading USD for ETH, it's fairly straightforward. And if you're not too price sensitive, look for a way to place a market order (as opposed to a limit order).</p><p>This may take you 30 minutes - 1 hour if you've never done it before. </p><h3 id=\"2-transfer-ether-to-a-wallet-metamask-\">2. Transfer Ether to a Wallet (Metamask)</h3><p>Once you have bought Ether, you'll need to transfer it to a wallet. I personally use <a href=\"https://metamask.io/index.html\">Metamask</a>, so that's what I will focus on.</p><p>Metamask is a browser extension available for Chrome, Firefox, and Brave. Install this extension and set up your wallet. </p><p>It will ask you to write down a list of recovery words. Find a secure place to save these.</p><p>Once you have your Metamask wallet set up, you will be able to see your wallet address. When you click Metamask, you'll see <code>Account 1</code> and underneath something like <code>0x....</code>. When you hover over that, it will say \"Copy to Clipboard\".</p><p>Now, go back to Coinbase Pro and withdraw your Ether. Set the destination address to be your Metamask address that you copied above.</p><h3 id=\"3-identify-yield-farming-opportunities\">3. Identify Yield Farming Opportunities</h3><p>For many of you reading this, steps 1 and 2 are things you might have done a long time ago. Thus, this is where it gets interesting.</p><p>Currently, the best place to go to find yield farming opportunities is <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com\">Coin Gecko</a>. Coin Gecko works hard to curate and list all sorts of investment vehicles in the crypto space. They are reputable and considered good faith actors. </p><p>As it pertains to yield farming, we want to focus on their \"<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/yield-farming\">Farms</a>\" tab. You'll see something like this:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/how-to-yield-farm/htyf_coin-gecko.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Coin Gecko\"></figure><p>Right now, lots of people are providing liquidity to Sushi and receiving yield on the SUSHI token. While I don't personally farm much SUSHI, it is the most popular asset at the moment, so we'll focus on that. </p><p>There are many ways to get SUSHI right now. They all involve providing liquidity to the following pairs on SushiSwap. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>ETH-USDT</li><li>ETH-USDC</li><li>ETH-DAI</li><li>ETH-SUSHI</li></ul><p>If we want to participate in yield farming, we'll need to acquire a pair of those assets, supply them to a SushiSwap liquidity pool, recieve an \"LP token\" and then stake that \"LP token\" to start getting a constant trickle of SUSHI token.</p><p>Let's focus on the ETH-SUSHI pair because that's giving a good healthy yield right now of over 100% APY.</p><p>Alright, so how do we do this?</p><h3 id=\"4-acquire-the-necessary-assets\">4. Acquire the Necessary Assets</h3><p>Our ultimate goal is to <strong>acquire liquidity provider tokens</strong>, or \"LP tokens\". For many yield farming opportunities, we need Uniswap LP tokens. In the case of SUSHI, we will need Sushi LP tokens or SLP. It is really important that you're clear on which platform the LP tokens need to be issued by. On Coin Gecko, they help by providing basic instructions. </p><p>I've annotated a screenshot below:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/how-to-yield-farm/htyf_understand-which-lp-platform.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Understanding which platform to provide liquidity\"></figure><p>But many times, you will need to do your own research and understand which assets you need to acquire. In the image above, I indicated \"???\" for those yield farming opportunities I could not immediately understand.</p><p>In the case of WETH-SUSHI, what we're after are the following assets:</p><ul><li>ETH-SUSHI LP Token on SushiSwap. Which we can \"create\" if we first acquire</li><li>ETH (ignore the W in WETH, regular ETH will work)</li><li>SUSHI token</li></ul><p>We already have ETH, as we transferred this to our Metamask wallet. Thus, that just leaves us with acquiring SUSHI token. How do we do that?</p><p>We go to an exchange. My preference is a decentralized exchange.</p><p>Uniswap is the biggest one. SushiSwap is a clone (and smaller - and has a questionable history). Thus, using either <a href=\"https://app.uniswap.org/\">Uniswap</a> or <a href=\"https://exchange.sushiswapclassic.org/#/swap\">SushiSwap</a>, we can trade some ETH for SUSHI token. </p><p><em>There are other decentralized exchanges out there, but these two are by far the easiest to get started with. Plus, you'll need to interact with them anyways to get your LP token.</em></p><p>This is what their interfaces for swapping look like. SushiSwap on the left, Uniswap on the right:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/how-to-yield-farm/htyf_sushi-v-uni.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"SushiSwap vs Uniswap\"></figure><p>As you can see, it looks very simple. You select the token you want to trade, and the token you want to receive. Then you press swap, accept some Metamask confirmations, wait for the transactions to process, and then you're done!</p><p><strong>Make sure to leave some ETH left over</strong>! You don't want to trade all of it for SUSHI, because you will need <strong>an even amount of both</strong> assets to provide liquidity.</p><p>If you can't find the SUSHI token, you might need to change the list that SushiSwap and Uniswap are using to find the tokens. When you click the dropdown menu to change your selection, you'll need to try a different list. Here's what I mean:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/how-to-yield-farm/htyf_find-token.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Changing lists\"></figure><p>You might need to try a couple lists to find the token you're looking for. There are other ways to get the token to show up (i.e. pasting the address in the text field), but this is the easiest.</p><p>Now that we have SUSHI and ETH, let's go get our ETH-SUSHI LP Token on SushiSwap. This is important that we do this next step on SushiSwap! To do this, go back to the <a href=\"https://exchange.sushiswapclassic.org/#/pool\">SushiSwap app</a>, but make sure to click on the Pool tab:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/how-to-yield-farm/htyf_providing-liquidity.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Providing Liquidity on SushiSwap\"></figure><p>When we provide liquidity, we must do so in a 1:1 proportion. That is, if we want to supply $100 of ETH, we must also supply $100 of SUSHI. This is why it's so important to leave some ETH in your wallet.</p><p>From this point, we just approve SUSHI, wait for that transaction to go through, and then click Supply - and wait for the second transaction to go through.</p><p>For our troubles, we'll now obtained a ETH-SUSHI LP Token! </p><h3 id=\"5-staking-and-collecting-yield\">5. Staking and Collecting Yield</h3><p>We can take our ETH-SUSHI LP Token and go to SushiSwap's farm (you can find this from either Coin Gecko, or navigating from SushiSwap's homepage). In our case, the farm is located on <a href=\"https://sushiswapclassic.org/farms/SUSHI-ETH%20SLP\">this page</a>.</p><p>You'll see something like this, where you can start staking:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/how-to-yield-farm/htyf_sushi-stake.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Start staking Sushi\"></figure><p><em>Your screen might look slightly different from mine because I've already begun staking, but the buttons will be mostly in the same location.</em></p><p>Again, press some buttons, specify how much you want to stake, do some Metamask confirmations, and when the transactions go through, you'll be staking!</p><p>The value of the SUSHI that you've farmed will show up on the left. Not to mention, you're earning liquidity provider fees on the funds you placed in SushiSwap too.</p><p>Congratulations, you're yield farming!</p><h2 id=\"understanding-yield-farming\">Understanding Yield Farming</h2><p>Now that you know how to yield farm (or have bookmarked this page for later), let's talk about what the yield farming opportunity really is.</p><p>At its core, we know that when we're yield farming, we're getting rewarded for providing liquidity, as well as for staking our LP tokens (basically, proof of liquidity).</p><p>Let's understand why we should be getting a liquidity fee and the risk we have when we do so (impermanent loss). And then let's talk about why anyone would issue tokens for us to \"stake\" our LP tokens.</p><h3 id=\"liquidity-fees\">Liquidity Fees</h3><p>Fundamentally, it makes sense why we should earn liquidity fees. We're providing our assets such that those who are looking to exchange one token for another have a market for this. They don't have to wait to find a buyer, and it's pretty seamless to go from the thought \"I want token Y\" to the action \"I will exchange X for Y\".</p><p>That requires liquidity. We're providing it. Uniswap is collecting fees on our behalf. When we redeem our LP tokens back for our underlying assets, we'll get a little bit more than we put in.</p><h3 id=\"impermanent-loss\">Impermanent Loss</h3><p>However, this is not risk free! Due to some rather interesting constraints and details of how Uniswap, SushiSwap, Balancer, and all such \"x * y = k\" exchanges work, we are subject to an opportunity cost known as impermanent loss.</p><p>I won't explain why it happens in this article (maybe later), but the effect is that in certain conditions, a liquidity provider may actually be worse off by providing liquidity to the pool, compared to doing nothing at all. What is that condition? </p><p>When the relative price of the two assets they're providing liquidity changes. So in our case, if either SUSHI becomes far more valuable than ETH or ETH becomes far more valuable than SUSHI, we're subject to impermanent loss. It's all about the relative price.</p><p>There are lots of calculators that will do this for you, but nothing I've found that monitors the relative prices and alerts you if you're experiencing significant impermanent loss. But it's very important to keep in mind while you're yield farming, otherwise, you put in all this effort and are now worse off than if you did nothing!</p><h3 id=\"why-do-i-want-sushi\">Why do I want SUSHI?</h3><p>One question you might be asking is, why do I even want SUSHI token anyways? Why am I staking my LP tokens to acquire it?</p><p>Well, the SUSHI token is a governance token - and when it comes to decentralized exchanges, it's relatively easy to see why that might be valuable. In the future, SUSHI might change the rules such that SUSHI token holders see a small share of the liquidity fee. In such a future, that would be like a dividend on a stock. Or, you might see SUSHI holders vote on other changes to the platform.</p><p>Governance tokens are a lot like equity in a company. A share of stock in a company allows you to vote on who the CEO should be, as well as a variety of other decisions. You also get dividends, when the company decides to issue them.</p><p>In crypto, there are lots of governance tokens for this reason. It's a model that is somewhat intuitive to those who come from a background in traditional finance. Of course, there are many other things we can do with tokens, but governance is the foundation.</p><p>Do I personally believe in the SUSHI token? I have no idea, but I think it's a good idea to have a little of both the SUSHI and UNI tokens. </p><h3 id=\"understanding-risk\">Understanding Risk</h3><p>If we take a moment and step back, we need to  properly evaluate risk. </p><p>We know there's the risk of impermanent loss. </p><p>Let's imagine a scenario where one of the underlying assets starts falling. Those who provided liquidity will start feeling the effects of impermanent loss. LPs will be pressured to exit the pool to get their underlying pair. But because one of the assets are falling in value, LPs may go back to the pool and trade the devalued asset for the more stable asset.</p><p>This could cause a massive collapse in the value of the asset experiencing a falling valuation.</p><p>Another risk is that the reward token's value plummets. In this case, the reward subsidy is decreasing in value. Now you're providing liquidity to a pool that you wouldn't have otherwise, risking impermanent loss for collecting minimal fees.</p><p>Reward tokens can plummet if they give out <strong>too many rewards too quickly</strong> (causing inflation and encouraging holders to sell), or if the <strong>project attracts short term farmers</strong> who don't want to hold the reward tokens (and dump the tokens as soon as they recieve it). In both of these cases, farming would put downward pressure on the reward token - it's hard to justify holding a token that's collapsing in value. (Although, for good projects with a clear max supply, this presents a solid buying opportunity).</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>I hope this was a helpful introduction on how to yield farm. We spent a lot of time talking about how to yield farm on SUSHI, but there are other opportunities out there.</p><p>Take the time to do your own research, think through which tokens you want earn via staking, and figure out if there's a path to yield farming that exposes you to risks that you are comfortable taking.</p><p>If you do all of these steps, you might realize that DeFi has come a long way. You can now:</p><ul><li>Earn crypto by providing liquidity on exchanges</li><li>Earn crypto by lending it out on something like Compound</li><li>Use your receipts of liquidity (LP tokens) and lending (i.e. cTokens) to generate more yield via staking </li><li>Easily transition one asset to another</li><li>Park your money in stablecoins, if you need a breather</li></ul><p>And much much more.</p><p>I personally had taken a break from crypto for many months and when I returned to the space, I was amazed by the capabilities of these platforms. The pace of innovation is crazy (everything is open source, so everything gets copied and tweaked).</p><p>This is just the beginning.</p>","comment_id":"5fb7ee474a5ff40cd0924b93","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/9/fields.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-11-20T16:26:47.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-12-16T16:57:39.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-11-20T20:38:29.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"Yield farming might not be as profitable as it was earlier this year, but if you're curious about this opportunity in DeFi, read this guide.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"tags":[{"id":"5fb7eee64a5ff40cd0924b98","name":"crypto","slug":"crypto","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2368/tag/crypto/"}],"primary_tag":{"id":"5fb7eee64a5ff40cd0924b98","name":"crypto","slug":"crypto","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2368/tag/crypto/"},"url":"http://localhost:2368/how-to-yield-farm/","excerpt":"Yield farming might not be as profitable as it was earlier this year, but if you're curious about this opportunity in DeFi, read this guide.","reading_time":10,"access":true,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null},"writing-day-30-of-30":{"id":"5fac1e2a4a5ff40cd09249db","uuid":"49bfbc25-b4d0-4d27-be15-6d494eb78026","title":"Day 30 of 30","slug":"writing-day-30-of-30","html":"<p>Whew!</p><p>It's done, it's finally done! When I started this challenge, the first post took me a couple hours to write, and I thought \"Hey, not bad, I'll get faster!\". Well, I didn't get faster, but I did make it to the finish.</p><p>In the end, (not counting today), I wrote <strong>26,285 words</strong> across 29 posts. I think I averaged about 2-3 hours a day, so let's just call that <strong>80 hours</strong>. </p><p>I'm happy with some of the posts I wrote, but others... let just say less so haha. Here's a meta-analysis of my posts:</p><ul><li>My favorite posts are \"teaching\" posts, where I push myself to do something and share the result. Examples: <a href=\"https://pliao39.com/writing-day-10-of-30\">Day 10 reflections</a>, <a href=\"https://pliao39.com/168-hours\">168 Hours</a> (on time tracking), <a href=\"https://pliao39.com/typeracer-4000\">Typeracer 4000</a> (on typing faster), <a href=\"https://pliao39.com/meditation-day-11\">Meditation Day 11</a> (on meditating more), <a href=\"https://pliao39.com/writing-day-20-of-30\">Day 20 reflections</a>, and of course, this post itself</li><li>Another solid category are \"notes\" posts, where I read or watch something and take notes on it. Examples: <a href=\"https://pliao39.com/notes-on-waitzkin-at-sohn\">Notes on Waitzkin at Sohn</a>, <a href=\"https://pliao39.com/postman-on-technology\">Neil Postman on Technology in 1998</a>, <a href=\"https://pliao39.com/feynman-and-dumb-questions\">Feynman and Dumb Questions</a></li><li>I also enjoyed writing a \"synthesis\" piece, where I pulled multiple different articles and tried to put my own spin on it: <a href=\"https://pliao39.com/legibility-and-software\">Legibility and Software</a></li><li>I finally started writing about Asian American issues (<a href=\"https://pliao39.com/where-are-you-from\">Where are you from</a> and <a href=\"https://pliao39.com/in-my-minor-feelings\">In my minor feelings</a>), something I'd been meaning to write about, but never pulled the trigger. When you're writing every day though, whatever is on your mind that day though is highly likely to turn into a post.</li><li>Some of the posts I published were based off work I had stated in the past, but hesitated to publish. Even though they're not perfect, publishing them is valuable. It pushes you to a level of introspection that improves your writing. <strong>Even if something isn't quite up to your vision, publish it anyways</strong>, you'll cringe but you'll learn. Much better than sitting on your ass and not improving. Some examples of this: <a href=\"https://pliao39.com/latent-value\">Latent Value</a>, <a href=\"https://pliao39.com/two-energies\">Two Energies</a></li></ul><p>So, in summary, here are the primary benefits of writing online every day for 30 days:</p><ul><li>I wrote about this before, but writing every day gives you an <strong>abundance mindset</strong>. You stop caring if a single post is good, because you know there will be more to come, and you know posting gives you something to build upon for next time</li><li>If you always wanted to create a <strong>home for yourself on the internet</strong>, this is an excellent way to do it. It's enough content that's diverse to represent a true multidimensional version of yourself. Someone who stumbles upon your website can click around and immerse themselves in your brain for a bit.</li><li>At this pace, you must choose either <strong>authenticity or garbage</strong>. You can't be perfect, so you've got to choose. I've produced a bit of both these last 30 days</li><li>Writing at this pace also forces you to consider your inputs. That means you need to read more, learn more, try more things and share. For me, this has resulted in an <strong>experimentation mindset</strong>, where I find myself wanting to try different things to share the results.</li></ul><p>Moving forward, here's how I plan to continue:</p><ul><li>Try to write on a cadence of <strong>about once or twice a week</strong>. Writing every day became a struggle towards the end, and it was very clearly unsustainable. If anyone is considering this challenge, I would reduce the duration to 21 days, and factor in a few cheat days to catch your breath. That said, the </li><li>Optimize for more experiments. I think my favorite articles are those which read like <strong>\"how-to\" guides.</strong> I'm going to continue trying different things and writing about them. My reflections on Typeracer and Meditation are sort of life this, but they can be optimized further to read like guides.</li><li>Also optimize for personal narratives, \"research\" posts, and other forms of higher quality content</li></ul><p>In short, I'm very happy with this \"starter set\" of content that I've created for myself. I feel like I compacted half a year worth of blogging into one month. However, moving forward, I intend to slow the pace down, improve quality, while keeping my voice authentic.</p><p>Right now - a huge exhale.

Your parents' nagging can live rent free in your head. Your co-workers' low quality work can live rent free in your head. Your roommates who never clean the dishes might be living rent free in your head (and possibly living rent free in your apartment as well).</p><p>The fact remains that there are objects of fixation that our minds just simply cannot shake. Some of them represent mundane items left undone - paying your taxes, getting your car serviced. Some of them represent larger projects - getting a new job, getting new roommates.

Those thoughts that live rent free in your mind will come back.</p><p>One super powerful hack to this, I've found, is group singing. When I was in college, I joined a choir. Having had no previous singing experience, I found it absolutely profound how singing in a group of people could take my mind off everything else. Group chanting, I've heard, produces a similar effect. There's something extremely powerful about human voices in unison that allows us to ignore problems.</p><h2 id=\"alignment\">Alignment</h2><p>If every single day, you feel like the work you do is supporting a business that you hate, then you've let a vampire into your life. This arrangement will drain you of vital energy.</p><p>The only long term solution is to make changes such that you're \"back in alignment\".

To do so, experimentation is key. </p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>Things that live rent free in your head are a huge drain on your livelihood.

So, here we are.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-minor-feelings\">What are Minor Feelings?</h2><p>CPH defines them as:</p><blockquote>the racialized range of emotions that are negative, dysphoric, and therefore untelegenic, built from the sediments of everyday racial experience and the irritant of having one's perception of reality constantly questioned or dismissed</blockquote><p>Minor feelings are confusion - \"having one's perception of reality constantly questioned\" - the experience of being relentlessly gaslit.</p><blockquote>When minor feelings are finally externalized, they are interpreted as hostile, ungrateful, jealous, depressing, and belligerent, affects ascribed to racialized behavior that whites consider out of line. Our feelings are overreactions because our lived experiences of structural inequity are not commensurate with their deluded reality.</blockquote><p>And when you speak up, you run the risk of inducing white tears.</p><h2 id=\"gas-lighting\">Gas Lighting</h2><p>Gas Lighting is a consistent theme in Asian lives and thus, in the book as well. </p><p>This quote hits so hard:</p><blockquote>When I hear the phrase “Asians are next in line to be white,” I replace the word “white” with “disappear.” Asians are next in line to disappear. We are reputed to be so accomplished, and so law-abiding, we will disappear into this country’s amnesiac fog. We will not be the power but become absorbed by power, not share the power of whites but be stooges to a white ideology that exploited our ancestors.</blockquote><p>Asians are told that we can succeed, but really, success just means to be a pawn.</p><blockquote>This country insists that our racial identity is beside the point, that it has nothing to do with being bullied, or passed over for promotion, or cut off every time we talk.</blockquote><h2 id=\"self-hate\">Self Hate</h2><blockquote>There’s a ton of literature on the self-hating Jew and the self-hating African American, but not enough has been said about the self-hating Asian.</blockquote><p>And with that, CPH starts writing some literature on what our self hate looks like:</p><blockquote>Your only defense is to be hard on yourself, which becomes compulsive, and therefore a comfort, to peck yourself to death. You don’t like how you look, how you sound. You think your Asian features are undefined, like God started pinching out your features and then abandoned you. You hate that there are so many Asians in the room. Who let in all the Asians? you rant in your head. Instead of solidarity, you feel that you are less than around other Asians, the boundaries of yourself no longer distinct but congealed into a horde.</blockquote><p>When I read that paragraph, I could feel every stinging word. When I was younger, I remember looking in the mirror one day and feeling helpless. I suddenly realized that my Chinese face was a problem that could never be solved. Thankfully, all that time shooting hoops in my driveway had tanned my skin, and I didn't quite look as light as all the other Asians. And thank god for that - what could be worse than to be like <em>them</em>?</p><h2 id=\"most-asian-stories-are-for-white-people\">Most Asian Stories are for White People</h2><p>When Asian stories are told, they're told for a white audience.</p><blockquote>our stories have been shaped by the white imagination.</blockquote><p>And those imaginations are pretty limited:</p><blockquote>Publishers treated the ethnic story as the “single story,” which Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie defines as follows: “Create a single story, show a people as one thing, as only one thing, over and over again, and that is what they become.”</blockquote><p>For example, the work of Jhumpa Lahiri:</p><blockquote>For the last twenty years, until recently, Jhumpa Lahiri’s stories were the template of ethnic fiction that supports the fantasy of Asian American immigrants as compliant strivers. The fault lies not in Lahiri herself, who I think is an absorbing storyteller, but in the publishing industry that used to position her books as the “single story” on immigrant life.</blockquote><h2 id=\"our-parents\">Our Parents</h2><p>Self hate isn't just reserved for yourself and the hordes of Asians at your school. If you've got self hate, there's a good chance you direct that towards your parents as well. </p><p>I know I did. </p><p>And when CPH writes this, it hit me like a pile of bricks:</p><blockquote>As a child, I picked up whatever distrust there was around Asians and animated my father’s absence with it. He often complained that I never took his side. Now, as an adult, I feel protective of him, which is why I was so moved when I read Sharma’s poem about her father. Whatever dignity our fathers have painstakingly built throughout the years is so fragile. I know this because I used to see my father the way other Americans saw him: with suspicion.</blockquote><p>CPH's reaction to a video of David Dao - at the time 69 years old - being dragged off a plane, hit home. The airline company had overbooked the flight, and when no one volunteered to step off the flight, the crew voluntold, then dragged Dao away against his will - I guess they happened to pick the stereotypically obedient elderly Asian man entirely at \"random\":</p><blockquote>“Dao reminds me of my father.” It wasn’t just that he was the same age as our fathers. It was also his trim and discreet appearance that made him familiar. His nondescript appearance was as much for camouflage as it was for comfort, cultivated to project a benign and anonymous professionalism. His appearance said: I am not one to take up space nor make a scene.</blockquote><p>That is not to say it's all love at home:</p><blockquote>No matter how much he worked, he could never save enough. He drank heavily during those years and fought with my mother, who beat my sister and me with a fury intended for my father.</blockquote><h2 id=\"imperialism\">Imperialism</h2><p>It's impossible to talk about Asian American history without mentioning imperialism. And with Hong, it's personal. This line makes it clear:</p><blockquote>I am here because you vivisected my ancestral country in two. In 1945, two fumbling mid-ranking American officers who knew nothing about the country used a National Geographic map as reference to arbitrarily cut a border to make North and South Korea, a division that eventually separated millions of families, including my own grandmother from her family. Later, under the flag of liberation, the United States dropped more bombs and napalm in our tiny country than during the entire Pacific campaign against Japan during World War II. A fascinating little-known fact about the Korean War is that an American surgeon, David Ralph Millard, stationed there to treat burn victims, invented a double-eyelid surgical procedure to make Asian eyes look Western, which he ended up testing on Korean sex workers so they could be more attractive to GIs. Now, it’s the most popular surgical procedure for women in South Korea. My ancestral country is just one small example of the millions of lives and resources you have sucked from the Philippines, Cambodia, Honduras, Mexico, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, El Salvador, and many, many other nations through your forever wars and transnational capitalism that have mostly enriched shareholders in the States. Don’t talk to me about gratitude.</blockquote><p>And, again, to remind the minorities of this country that there are nefarious roots that unite:</p><blockquote>Whether our families come from Guatemala, Afghanistan, or South Korea, the immigrants since 1965 have shared histories that extend beyond this nation, to our countries of origin, where our lineage has been decimated by Western imperialism, war, and dictatorships orchestrated or supported by the United States. In our efforts to belong in America, we act grateful, as if we’ve been given a second chance at life. But our shared root is not the opportunity this nation has given us but how the capitalist accumulation of white supremacy has enriched itself off the blood of our countries. We cannot forget this.</blockquote><h2 id=\"asian-women\">Asian Women</h2><p>The issues that Asian women face in this country are real and severe. Dismissal. Fetishization. Worse.</p><p>Theresa Hak Kyung Cha was a poet/photographer/artist who inspired CPH.</p><p>In one of her essays, CPH tells the story of Cha's death - of her rape and murder - a case that numbs the mind.</p><blockquote>Digging into Cha’s bibliography, I was surprised that no one wrote anything about the crime. If her homicide is mentioned at all, it’s treated as an unpleasant fact, acknowledged in one terse sentence before the scholar rushes off to write about narrative “indeterminacy” in Dictee. More disturbing is that no one admits that Cha was also raped, an omission so stubborn I had to consult court records to confirm that she was also sexually assaulted. Did they not know? Were they skittish? Murder has been desensitized to a crime statistic, but combine it with the word rape and it forces you to confront her body.</blockquote><p>CPH later spoke with a friend of Cha's, inquiring about the media silence after Cha's death:</p><blockquote>When I asked Flitterman-Lewis why she thought there was no media coverage of Cha’s rape and homicide at the time, she said without hesitation, “She was just another Asian woman. If she were a young white artist from the Upper West Side, it would have been all over the news.”</blockquote><p>Dismissal. Fetishization. Worse.</p><h2 id=\"white-tears\">White Tears</h2><p>CPH discusses the rather sensitive topic of white tears:</p><blockquote>Of course, “white tears” does not refer to all pain but to the particular emotional fragility a white person experiences when they find racial stress so intolerable they become hypersensitive and defensive, focusing the stress back to their own bruised ego.</blockquote><p>Inducing them, however, may be dangerous:</p><blockquote>In feeling wrong, they feel wronged. In being asked to be made aware of racial oppression, they feel oppressed. While we laugh at white tears, white tears can turn dangerous.</blockquote><p>This is quite the conundrum. How do you straddle the line between speaking truth without inducing white tears? This is the challenge of defusing a bomb, and I have no answers.</p><h2 id=\"asian-complictness\">Asian Complictness</h2><p>When CPH talks about Asians becoming \"stooges to a white ideology\", I felt called out.</p><p>It's the Uncle Toms. The \"house\" Asian. It's a growing phenomenon. </p><p>I wonder, to what extent have I propagated a way of life that promotes a racialized hierarchy. To what extent do my actions today still give momentum to such forces?</p><p>Towards the end of her book, CPH writes:</p><blockquote>“In the future, white supremacy will no longer need white people,” the artist Lorraine O’Grady said in 2018, a prognosis that seemed, at least on the surface, to counter what James Baldwin said fifty years ago, which is that “the white man’s sun has set.” Which is it then? What prediction will hold? As an Asian American, I felt emboldened by Baldwin but haunted and implicated by O’Grady. I heard the ring of truth in her comment, which gave me added urgency to finish this book. Whiteness has already recruited us to become their junior partners in genocidal wars; conscripted us to be antiblack and colorist; to work for, and even head, corporations that scythe off immigrant jobs like heads of wheat.</blockquote><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>The book Minor Feelings is far more than a collection of quotes. But I wanted to keep some of them handy such I could reference them in the future.

This book doesn't hold back.</p><p>If you're Asian American, pick up a copy now. If you're not, pick up a copy now.</p><p>Tomorrow, I'll pluck select quotes from the book and analyze them. But today, I wanted to be in my feelings.</p><p>To be Asian American is to have your experience steamrolled into the model minority. You cannot be sad or hurt because you are \"successful\". You cannot voice your pain because you’re, at this point, \"basically white\". Asians are \"doing well\" they say.</p><p>Minor Feelings is a book about dismissal and erasure. Self hate, intergenerational trauma, colonialism, war, lynching, rape - are all forgotten from the Asian American story. </p><p>By writing this book, Cathy seems to say \"Not on my watch\".</p><p>Throughout the book, she speaks truth to issues so frequently ignored, and by doing so, she gives Asian Americans a voice to build upon. In the future, we will cite her lines when we cannot find the words of our own. </p><p>But Asians are quiet not simply because we lack the vocabulary. A secondary reason is that whiteness is so comfortable speaking for us. Whiteness whitesplains the Asian experience, dousing our stories - no, drowning our stories - in bleach. The result is something pale and uniform, and has been cleansed of the blood stains and dirt, but also stripped of its original color and complexity. The final result reeks. Bleach is, after all, an industrial grade sterilizer, a chemical irritant.</p><p>Times are changing. Perhaps those born on the coasts, where a critical mass of Asians Americans live, are beginning to find a racial consciousness that makes young people proud of their heritage and empowered to share their stories.</p><p>And while I sense this is happening, I also still see meekness. Fear. The \"nail that sticks up gets hammered down\" kind of mentality. It's like a prisoner's dilemma, where silence has forever been the dominant strategy.</p><p>But Cathy Park Hong has stood up. She is the nail that was supposed to be hammered down. And her vulnerability paves the way.</p><p>There is so much left to do - Minor Feelings is written with a certain haste, a certain realization that right now, the iron is hot. Parts of the book feel open ended, certain issues not fully addressed. Cathy is deeply aware they exist, even leaving observations and quotes in her essays unanalyzed, as if inviting you to add your own story.</p><p>The Asian American experience is to be caged but told you are not caged. Hong calls bullshit, turns off the gas light, and invites us to cooperate with her, to tear down this Prisoner's Dilemma with truth - and unity.</p>","comment_id":"5fa85b1f4a5ff40cd09245a5","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517594422361-5eeb8ae275a9?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-11-08T20:54:55.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-11-08T21:58:38.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-11-08T21:51:52.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"Reacting to \"Minor Feelings\" by Cathy Park Hong","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"tags":[{"id":"5f8cc16b19c6bb174840575c","name":"asian american issues","slug":"asian-american-issues","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2368/tag/asian-american-issues/"}],"primary_tag":{"id":"5f8cc16b19c6bb174840575c","name":"asian american issues","slug":"asian-american-issues","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2368/tag/asian-american-issues/"},"url":"http://localhost:2368/in-my-minor-feelings/","excerpt":"Reacting to \"Minor Feelings\" by Cathy Park Hong","reading_time":2,"access":true,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null},"latent-value":{"id":"5fa74a1c4a5ff40cd0924360","uuid":"29250199-66bf-4ffb-ae73-7d6c9ba98988","title":"Latent Value","slug":"latent-value","html":"<p>You're probably familiar with the marshmallow test. </p><p>As a quick reminder, it was a study done on young children, who all presumably liked marshmallows. One by one, researchers led kids to a room with a single marshmallow on a table. The researchers mentioned that they had to go, but that if the marshmallow was still on the table when they returned, they would give the kid two marshmallows.</p><p>After 15 to 20 minutes of locking the child with temptation, the researcher would return and fulfill their promise.</p><p>In follow up studies many years later, they found that children who \"delayed gratification\" had better test scores as young adults, among other measurements of \"competence\".</p><p>The message from this study was clear - delay gratification and you'll be more successful.</p><p>Now, this is a nice little story, but life isn't so neat. Optimizing for the long term isn't as simple as doing things that are slightly difficult now, in order to reap compound rewards in the future. </p><p>I believe that optimizing for the future requires leading a life that generates a lot of \"latent value\". Let me show you a few examples of what I'm talking about.</p><h2 id=\"code-names\">Code Names</h2><p>In the party game Code Names, 25 cards are laid out on a table, each containing a single word. There are two teams, each who has a spymaster and a group of guessers. The spymasters have access to a \"map\" that informs them which cards are theirs and which ones are their opponents. In alternating fashion, the opposing spymasters give their team a clue - a word and a number. The word is a hint, and the number conveys how many cards the hint applies to.</p><p>The goal, of course, is to get your team to guess all of the words before the other team guesses theirs.</p><p>There is an interesting strategy where an ambitious spymaster will provide a clue that that applies to a large number of words. Quite often, this gamble doesn’t pan out. Despite the lack of success, it was not for nought. In later rounds, this failed clue provides the backdrop for future clues. With this additional context, future guesses become slightly easier.</p><p>Teams can reap the rewards of their previously failed ambition.</p><h2 id=\"cups-of-water\">Cups of Water</h2><p>Before he fell off the proverbial cliff, M. Night Shyamalan was creating movies with mind bending plot twists.</p><p>One of his better films is the movie \"Signs\", in which aliens invade some generic farm in the American midwest. </p><p>I don't remember much from the film, except for the fact that there's a little girl and throughout the movie she's grabbing cups for water, and leaving them around the house unfinished.</p><p>The cups end up everywhere and it's a huge nuisance to the rest of the family.</p><p>But - plot development! - it turns out that water burns alien flesh as if it's acid. Towards the end of the movie, all these cups of water become useful weapons as the family fends off the alien invasion.</p><p>The family was saved by their little girl's previously annoying habit of leaving cups of water all over the house. What seemed useless and possibly annoying, became useful much later.</p><h2 id=\"latent-value\">Latent Value</h2><p>My mom likes to counsel me “不走弯路”/”bù zǒu wānlù”. It translates to “don’t take the winding path” - the implication being that if you’re trying to get from point A to point B, the best route is the straight line.</p><p>Yes, it's a bit annoying to hear this, but I know what my mom is trying to say. She's conveying cautionary tales with those four words - of people that she's seen, and of paths she's taken herself.</p><p>But it's also true that life doesn't always work out the way you draw it up. You might beeline for a path of success, only to realize that you've changed and you hate the thing you've been chasing.</p><p>I don't have great advice here, but I do think there's an alternative to optimizing for guaranteed success. Rather, try to live a life that generates latent value. Trying hard things and failing. Doing things that feel nautral and energize you. These are the seeds of latent value.</p><p>Who knows, your YouTube creator failed ambitions might just open up a path to becoming the defender of our planet from aliens. </p>","comment_id":"5fa74a1c4a5ff40cd0924360","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518691340140-512e66ce957b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-11-08T01:30:04.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-11-08T17:00:47.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-11-08T02:55:43.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"Sometimes, we succeed because of seemingly unwise or strange decisions we made in the past","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"tags":[{"id":"5f8a00e619c6bb1748405507","name":"life","slug":"life","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2368/tag/life/"}],"primary_tag":{"id":"5f8a00e619c6bb1748405507","name":"life","slug":"life","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2368/tag/life/"},"url":"http://localhost:2368/latent-value/","excerpt":"Sometimes, we succeed because of seemingly unwise or strange decisions we made in the past","reading_time":3,"access":true,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null},"meditation-day-11":{"id":"5fa587004a5ff40cd0924120","uuid":"c0e682ba-2174-4528-a99a-cc31f3d35ff3","title":"Meditation: Day 11","slug":"meditation-day-11","html":"<p>11 days ago, I started a meditation practice after stumbling across Naval’s tweetstorm (...for the second time - his stuff reverberates on the Internet):</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Meditation - The Art of Doing Nothing:</p>&mdash; Nav.al (@naval) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naval/status/1261481222359801856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 16, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</figure><p>I’ve tried establishing a regular meditation practice many times in the past, from classes at Buddhist monasteries, to Headspace and other meditation apps - but I couldn't get them to stick.</p><p>And then I read this comment from Naval:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sixty minutes are easier than thirty, as it takes time for the mind to settle down.<br><br>Sixty consecutive days are needed, just as it takes time for the body to go from unfit to fit.</p>&mdash; Nav.al (@naval) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naval/status/1261482182469513216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 16, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</figure><p>\"Sixty minutes are easier than thirty\".</p><p>Perhaps that was what I was doing wrong. I wasn't meditating for long enough. </p><p>So I started doing that. This is my first \"check-in\".</p><h2 id=\"my-setup\">My Setup</h2><p>Before I discuss my experience, I wanted to share how I meditate.</p><p><strong>Insight Timer App</strong></p><p>I use the Insight Timer App to keep track of the hour. </p><p>For the first 10 days, I had configured the app to start with the \"Wood Block\", and finish with the \"Kangse\" bell. However, today, I switched the ending bell to a Gong (has a nice sense of finality) and I added a Kangse interval bell at the ~45 minute mark.</p><p>I previously noticed that the Kangse bell helped me regain my focus during meditation. But that was happening at the end of the practice, so I moved it earlier in the session to reap that benefit. I expect I'll play around with the interval bells quite a bit.</p><p>Overall, Insight Timer is a great timer, but they've stuck all of these weird community features into the app. I just want the timer and the bells.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/meditation_insight-timer.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Insight Timer App\"></figure><p></p><p><strong>Sitting</strong></p><p>I started by sitting on a cushioned chair. This worked well.</p><p>Then around day 7, I moved to sitting cross legged on a mattress on the floor. Like this:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/meditation_sitting-position.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Sitting on a mattress\"></figure><p>I've tried meditation cushions in the past, but they're not quite \"tall\" enough for me. Discomfort is one thing, but what really affected my meditation practice was that this would cause my legs to fall asleep. Sitting on a mattress helps quite a bit.</p><p>The first few days I started sitting on a mattress, I was able to sit for about 45 minutes. The last 15 minutes, I finished sitting in a chair. More recently, I was able to go the full hour sitting on the mattress, but today, I had to return to the chair.</p><p><strong>Noise</strong></p><p>I'm in a generally quiet area, and don't hear any voices. That said, I do hear the sound of airplanes flying over head, lawn mowers around, and other neighborhood sounds. I really like these sounds as I can focus on them for a moment and this helps me calm my thoughts and return to my meditation practice. Not that it lasts, my mind always finds a way to wander.</p><p><strong>Before and After</strong></p><p>Before I meditate, I spend a moment to record my mental state. Sometimes, I have a lot on my mind and there's a bit to write. I do the same after I meditate, and record my experience. Sometimes, I have to record \"to dos\" and ideas that arose during meditation.</p><p>I find that this helps me calm the mind a little before meditation, and the notes after meditation are helpful to see how my mental state changed over the hour.</p><p><strong>Focus</strong></p><p>In the past, I've tried a variety of meditation techniques:</p><ul><li>Belly breaths with my <strong>attention on the belly.</strong> Alternatively, you can focus on the tip of your nose (I don't do that because it gives me a headache. I just focus on the rise and fall of my belly)</li><li>Breath counting (inhale \"one\", exhale \"two\", continue until 10, and then restart. If you notice your mind wanders at any time before 10, just restart)</li><li>Chanting a mantra in my mind, usually \"I love myself\". This mantra  comes from the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Love-Yourself-Like-Your-Depends-dp-0062968726/dp/0062968726/ref=dp_ob_title_bk\">Love Yourself, Like your Life Depends on It</a>, which was written by Kamal Ravikant. (Yes, that's Naval's brother!)</li></ul><p>These days, I use a combination of these techniques, switching them whenever I feel like it. I often use a mantra if I want to embrace a certain feeling (very often acceptance of the present situation). But most of the time, I try to do nothing.</p><h2 id=\"reflection\">Reflection</h2><p>Sadly, I have to report that 11 hours of meditation has not fundamentally changed me. </p><p>I am not suddenly much more focused. I am not suddenly a far more positive person. I am not monk-like in my attitude. In fact, it has felt like <strong>very little has changed</strong>.</p><p>But, as I've learned from <a href=\"http://localhost:2368/meditation-day-11/pliao39.com/typeracer-4000\">Typeracer</a>,  skill acquisition can feel imperceptible even on a weekly level, and some days, you will actually feel like you're getting worse. So I'm sticking with it. </p><p>Here's what I've noticed so far:</p><ul><li>My mind does take a while to settle. Naval is absolutely right - <strong>60 minutes is easier than 30</strong>. Or in my case, 60 is easier than 8. If you are meditating, and are only doing something in the range of 10 minutes, I encourage you to expand your sessions to 60 minutes</li><li><strong>My mind loves to ask \"what time is it?\"</strong>. This might be one of the most common thoughts I get. On a few occasions, I have succumbed and checked the time :P</li><li>On most sessions, the first 30 minutes of the practice is \"noisier\". But <strong>sometimes, the second half is noisier</strong>. This feels like I got less calm during the session. In these situations, I try to finish strong and use the sound of the finishing bells to regain focus and meditate for a few deep breaths (sometimes a few minutes after the bells finish)</li><li>It can <strong>sometimes be difficult to be \"kind\" to yourself</strong> whenever your mind wanders. I'm often very playful when I notice my \"monkey mind\" wandering, but on particularly stressful days, I notice myself getting frustrated with my inability to meditate. The key, I've found, is to be kind to that frustration as well. Negativity goes away when embraced by nonchalance and kindness</li><li>After meditating, it is easier for me to <a href=\"https://pliao39.com/getting-into-flow\">get into a flow state</a>. There have been a couple days this week where I transitioned from meditation to flow relatively seamlessly.</li><li><strong>Very often, I hear an earworm.</strong> Sometimes, it's just a random phrase from a lo-fi beat. Other times, it's the hook of a song. Unlike other thoughts, these things just don't go away for me. The only thing that helps is to use the noises that I hear. Lawnmowers are useful!</li><li>Naval mentioned that meditation can be like self therapy. So far in my experience, I would say <strong>I experienced therapy-like sessions one time out of eleven</strong>. I wouldn't be surprised if this continues to happen</li><li>One of the fun things that pops up are <strong>images of places I've been</strong>. During meditation, I've spontaneously revisited places I've been to - some of them beautiful, some of them not, and some of them a combination of both (SF). I don't dwell on these images, but they are a nice treat</li></ul><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>For anyone considering a meditation practice, I encourage you to go \"all in\" on the 60 x 60 challenge.

This takes a lot of work, and on average, only one computer finds such a number every 10 minutes across the globe </li><li>The <strong>difficulty adjustment</strong> - an ingeniously simple way of making sure mining continues to take 10 minutes on average, even in the face of additional mining power. After each block, the Bitcoin protocol looks at the time it took to mine the previous 2016 blocks (2 weeks), and if this trailing average drops, it decreases the target number proportionally, such that it becomes even less likely that any random number generate a valid hash. Or if mining power has left the network, it would relax the difficulty by increasing the target number.</li><li><strong>Merkle Proofs</strong> - a data-light way to validate membership of a transaction in a particular block.</li></ul><p>But probably the simplest one is the algorithm that governs Bitcoin's scarcity. Every 210,000 blocks (just a shade under 4 years), Bitcoin's mining reward gets cut in half.</p><p>This exponential decay in the increase of Bitcoin's supply means that there is an asymptote. The maximum number of  Bitcoin that can ever exist ist 21 million. All thanks to a dead simple \"let's divide by 2 every 4 years\".</p><h2 id=\"tcp\">TCP </h2><p>TCP uses both exponential growth and exponential decay to find a globally acceptable rate of transmission. I find TCP to be an amazing protocol - it somehow avoids the tragedy of the commons (our computers don't overwhelm the underlying infrastructure) - but here's the kicker - <strong>without central coordination</strong>. It is a distributed algorithm that works!</p><p>A little backstory. Early on in the development of TCP, the original researchers were focused on producing a protocol that made sure that the two sides of a TCP connection didn't overwhelm each other. Well, more specifically, that the sender didn't overwhelm the receiver. This was (and is) done by agreeing on a \"recieve window\", which is the buffer size of the recipient.</p><p>Things worked well on the individual level and during inital tests, things looked great. Time to deploy!</p><p>But when they released this version of TCP, they noticed that as soon as lots of computers joined the network, the experience degraded for everyone. The early Internet became almost unusable.</p><p>In thinking only of themselves, the two sides of a TCP connection had failed to consider the shared resource: the underlying network that powers the Internet. Our researchers had to figure out a way to bake in awareness of the underlying network, without expensive central coordination.</p><p>They did that with two primary tools: packet loss detection and exponents.</p><p>They came up with \"slow start\" and \"congestion avoidance\":</p><ul><li>Start transmission at some slow rate. Double that rate of transmission if everything goes through. (<strong>exponential growth</strong>) </li><li>Keep on doubling until <strong>packet loss</strong> is detected </li><li>Now that packet loss is detected, cut the rate of transmission in half, and increase the rate linearly. Any time packet loss is detected again, cut the transmission again in half (sort of like <strong>exponential decay</strong>) and again linearly increase the rate</li></ul><p>What's awesome about this is you get globally optimal behavior without sacrificing much on the local level. By making rational self limitations (cutting your usage in half only when you notice you've pushed the network beyond its limit), you maintain the health of the system.</p><p>This level of algorithmic contientiousness is beautiful to me. By focusing on yourself, but thoughtfully adjusting behavior the moment you sense that you're negatively impacting the larger community, TCP has allowed the Internet to flourish.</p><p>If only humans could be made aware the moment they've created negative externalities and be forced to adjust their behavior - then maybe selfishness could work 🤔</p><h2 id=\"retries\">Retries</h2><p>Despite the brilliance of TCP, when computers communicate with each other, there is no guarantee that the transmission will be successful. Sometimes, the underlying network will break down. Other times, the other party will simply fail.</p><p>In these cases, we need to reattempt our communication requests. Should we wait a minute? Maybe a random amount?</p><p>As a developer community, we've converged on utilizing <strong>exponential backoff</strong>. The reason is again contientiousness - an aggressive retry strategy can overwhelm the service under load, making a bad situation worse. Exponential backoff straddles the line between \"giving them space\", but \"not giving up\".</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>Hope you found these observations interesting. Perhaps it'll trigger you to think more about:</p><ul><li>Globally optimal, locally suboptimal scenarios</li><li>Exponential growth and asymptotes</li></ul><p>Whether you can apply them to your own life is beyond the scope of what I wanted to say. However, I do believe there is wisdom in simple algorithms.</p><p>Until next time.</p>","comment_id":"5fa4154519c6bb1748407361","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1543286386-713bdd548da4?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-11-05T15:07:49.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-11-05T17:04:33.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-11-05T17:04:33.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"What do Bitcoin, TCP, and retries have in common?

Identify the forces, determine the equilibrium.</p><p>I think a similar concept can be applied to our personal lives. Maybe it's something along the lines of: Show me when your dopamine receptors activate and I'll show you the result.</p><p>I know very little about neuroscience, but I really do think it's that simple. When does your brain want to reward you? When does your brain try to protect you? If you know those things, you'll find your equilibrium.</p><h2 id=\"you-re-probably-at-an-equilibrium\">You're Probably at an Equilibrium</h2><p>Most people are comfortable. We find a situation that is \"good enough\" and stay there, far longer than we should. </p><p>There are good reasons for this. Needless risk taking is a bad idea. Our ability to imagine negative outcomes helps to keep us alive and keep us in check. </p><p>Thus we stay in our comfort zones - our brains help us visualize the downside, and we keep doing what we always do.</p><h2 id=\"behavior-change\">Behavior Change</h2><p>Behavior change often gets prompted via some form of advice. Atomic Habits. YouTube Self Improvement Influencers. Blog posts like this one.</p><p>They might be inspiring, but they don't actually cause behavior change, just the tantalizing potential that there might be something better.</p><p>To really start behavior change, we need to start rewiring our brains.</p><p>In the coming weeks, here are topics I'll look into:</p><ul><li>Cognitive Behavior Therapy</li><li>Trauma</li><li>Exposure Therapy</li><li>Meditation</li><li>Yoga, Taichi</li><li>Exercise</li><li>Breathing</li><li>Habits and Addiction</li><li>Massive change (i.e. starting a new job, quitting a job, breaking up with someone, moving to a new country)</li></ul><p>I believe that true behavior change means we need to understand what's going on in our brains.

I delayed breakfast for two hours.</p><h2 id=\"getting-into-flow\">Getting into Flow</h2><p>I was speaking with a friend today and he mentioned a term I had almost forgotten about - flow. Years ago, the idea blew my mind. If I could get into a flow state more often, that would change everything!</p><p>And like all new ideas, it vanished with the news cycle. 3 months later, the amount of time I spent in flow state didn't change.</p><p>But just the sheer mention of the term by my friend today brought that idea back into the spotlight. It was time to figure out how to get myself into flow.</p><h2 id=\"metawork\">Metawork</h2><p>Previously, I've written about <a href=\"https://pliao39.com/metawork\">metawork</a>. It's the idea that if everything is created twice (once in your mind and once in reality). </p><p>In my life, I have found this to be true: if I don't do the metawork before the work, I often find myself bumbling around. It's a miracle that progress eventually gets made, but the quality of the work is low, and the efficiency is poor. </p><p>One connection I had previously missed was the connection between metawork, clarity, and flow states.</p><p>I'm now realizing that metawork is a necessary condition to getting into flow because it provides your clarity.</p><h2 id=\"clarity\">Clarity</h2><p>There are a lot of triggers that can put you into a flow state, but I believe the most important one is focus. In order to focus, however, you must know what you are focusing on. In other words, the object of your focus must be clear.</p><p>When you know exactly what you need to do next, so much anxiety and stress seems to fade. It's as if the universe says, \"Ok, so let's get that done and then re-evaluate\".</p><h2 id=\"small-wins\">Small wins</h2><p>Sometimes, the difficulty is not that you don't have a clear goal, but that the goal is too far out. Your goal today might be to write a chapter in your novel, but if you're struggling to write a single page, that goal might be counter productive.</p><p>This might be obvious for those who have studied the flow state diagram:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://positivepsychology.com/wp-content/uploads/Flow-State-Model.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Flow state diagram\"></figure><p>When you make goals too ambitious and unrealistic, you put yourself in an anxiety inducing scenario.</p><p>A great hack is to find the smallest celebration worthy milestone you can set for yourself and chase the small win.</p><p>For software: Instead of making the entire feature work, we should make sure our components talk to each other end to end first. </p><p>For writing: Instead of writing a chapter, make an outline. Or try turning off your monitor and just brainstorming whatever ideas come to mind.</p><p><strong>Whatever you're trying to do, there is almost always a less ambitious version. </strong>Figure out what that is and consider starting there. A quick win under your belt will push you into flow.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>I'm currently learning more about flow states. This time, guided by the idea that you haven't learned something until it's driven behavior change, I plan to implement some combination of tactics to improve the likelihood of reaching flow.</p><p>I might never quite reach that state consistently, but I do believe the following items helped me out today:</p><ul><li>Meditation</li><li>Pre-distraction work (starting tasks before looking at email, social media, news, etc)</li><li>Achieving clarity (doing the metawork, in this case, in the days before)</li><li>Setting small goals</li></ul><p>I've picked up the book Stealing Fire, and I hope to learn a few things from that.</p><p>I hope this post helped you think about focus and good luck with getting into flow!</p>","comment_id":"5fa20e3619c6bb1748407172","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1489447068241-b3490214e879?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-11-04T02:13:10.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-11-04T04:02:37.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-11-04T03:59:09.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"Yesterday and today could not have been more different - and the difference was flow.

Mantas Donelavicius <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mantasd/touch-typing-how-long-does-it-take-to-reach-100-wpm-129ba855d038\">recorded his progress</a> as well and found that it took him on average 2 hours and 40 minutes to increase his typing speed by 1 WPM. </p><p>I think it's pretty safe to say that over the long run, you'll be able to see pretty consistent improvement over time.

But it'll probably be within the bound of 2-4 hours per 1 WPM increase.</p><h2 id=\"the-ups-and-downs\">The ups and downs</h2><p>While it's nice to be able to say \"on average, you'll improve around 1 WPM every 2-4\" hours that's <em>not</em> how it will feel. Every day will feel like a roller coaster.</p><p>Let's look at some data again.</p><p>Here's a graph of the 30 day moving average (in blue), this time starting from race 1000. I've also plotted the 100 day moving average (in red):</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/tr4000_trailing100.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Graph of 30 and 100 day moving average\"></figure><p>As you can see, the march to the top is not linear. </p><p>The reason I used a 30 race average (again, in blue) is because that's how many races I often do in a day. And as you can see from the data, there were days where I felt that I was actually regressing. That felt terrible. Sometimes, I'd be in a slump for multiple days.</p><p>If you look at the red line (100 race average) it's pretty clear that from race 1000 to 2000, it consistently felt like I was about to \"break out\", only for it not to happen. That was a pretty bad time.</p><p>Now, let's layer on some more moving averages: the 250 (yellow) and 1000 (green). </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/tr4000_trailing-all.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"30, 100, 250 and 1000 race moving average\"></figure><p></p><h3 id=\"thinking-in-weeks\">Thinking in weeks</h3><p>250 races is about how many races I could do in a week (if I was practicing every day) - so this represents \"thinking in weeks\". The 250 race moving average (yellow line) is a bit more forgiving, but it still has ups and downs. </p><h3 id=\"thinking-in-months\">Thinking in months</h3><p>1000 races is about how many races I could do in a month (if I was racing every day, which I didn't). This approximates \"thinking in months and longer\". </p><p>It's really with the 1000 race moving average (green line) where you can start seeing the linear improvement that everyone wants to have. </p><p>This was interesting for me to see because it shows how much variance there is in a given day or even a week. However, once we shift our perspective to thinking in months, a lot of the noise gets eliminated.</p><p>So, what's the lesson here? Progess might look linear from the outside, but you'll experience it as a series of ups and downs - where the crashes are far more memorable than the improvements. They will make you want to quit, and you probably will need to take some extended \"vacations\" as a result. It's only when you zoom out into the long run, that you'll get the motivation to continue.</p><p>This is a lesson you can learn from anything, but I'm just excited I can visualize it.</p><h2 id=\"other-lessons-and-observations\">Other Lessons and Observations</h2><p>I've learned quite a bit from doing these races. Some of them have to do with typing. Others have nothing to do with it.</p><ul><li><strong>Juggling</strong> - I learned to juggle at some point while doing type racer. Anecdotally, on the days I practiced juggling, I noticed an increase in typing speed. Obviously, this isn't scientific at all, but it was a pretty cool sensation - juggle for 10 minutes, suddenly fingers feel noticeably faster</li><li><strong>Serendipity</strong> - Typeracer sends you passages from all sorts of random sources. I love how I might be typing out something from Fight Club one moment, Dostoevsky the next, and learning about Comedy Secrets a minute later. I've been exposed to a handful of very interesting ideas this way</li><li><strong>Familiarity</strong> - Switching keyboards slows you down a lot. If you're going for speed, switching keyboards constantly will be a huge drag on your performance. Try to use the same keyboard.</li><li><strong>Strictness</strong> - There are other typing websites, but Type Racer is my favorite by far. It's unforgiving when it comes to mistakes and punctuation. I think it makes you better at typing our sentences then the other products out there.</li><li><strong>Stomaching Lows</strong> - When I frst started Type racer, I had the urge to \"escape\" a bad race by refreshing my browser. This prevents a bad race from being recorded in my stats. I still do this from time to time, but most of the time, I gut it out, even if it will bring down my average. But <strong>thinking in long term trends</strong> means that a single bad race won't define my skill. I can roll with the ups and downs</li></ul><p>There's so much more to say about Typeracer. It's truly given me a quantifiable skill that I can work on, has nice secondary benefits in all of the work that I do, but most importantly, has taught me that skill acquisition is not a linear process. It's one thing to know this in the abstract, it's another to see it in the data.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed this post!

I didn't say, \"I'm going to move my shoulder over, move my body.\" No, the music pushed me over, which is why I call it one-buttock playing.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/wd20of30_zander_one_buttock.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"One-buttock playing\"></figure><p>I don't know what the equivalent for \"impulses\" are for writing online, but I do know that forcing yourself to publish at a pace that is beyond comfortable brings something out of you.</p><p>It might even push you to write with one buttock. Will not confirm nor deny if I've had such an experience over the last 20 days.</p><h2 id=\"abundance\">Abundance</h2><p>For the last few years, I've been playing a typing game called Typeracer. Here's a graph of my first 1000 races:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/wd20of30_typeracer1000.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"First 1000 races\"></figure><p></p><p>As you can see, this graph is extremely noisy, and looks a bit like a seismograph.</p><p>But if you look closely, towards the right of the graph, you can see some \"space\" where the 75 WPM (words per minute) mark is visible. It's as if the seismograph has shifted.</p><p>Now, let's take a look at all my races (3800):</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/wd20of30_typeracer3800.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"3800 races\"></figure><p>Still a ton of variance, but if you squint, there's a trend!</p><p>To see what that looks like, I plotted the trailing 100 race average on a chart:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/wd20of30_typeracer-smoothed.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"smoothed race data\"></figure><p>Ah, so now we can see the trends clearly, unobstructed by the noise.</p><p>When you only do a single Typeracer competition, you're going to feel like your skill level is determined by your performance on that one race. But when you do thousands, your skill level is determined by the trend line.</p><p>When you're the only X in a room full of Y, there's this sense that you must speak for all of X. But if you're one of many, then you can relax and not worry about representing an entire group.</p><p>When you only have one essay on your website, that one essay must speak for you. But when you write something every day, your internet presence is defined by your body of work. One low quality post won't define you.</p><p>That's the beauty of abundance.</p><h2 id=\"foundations\">Foundations</h2><p>Right now, I feel like I'm writing to the crowd that \"was there from the start\", except it's still the start and no one else is here, and it's not clear that they'll be joining.</p><p>Regardless, this work feels necessary. At the very least, it's forced me to clarify my thinking, and put some ideas to text. I've written some articles I will very likely build upon in the near future:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://pliao39.com/good-meeting\">Good meetings</a></li><li><a href=\"https://pliao39.com/good-teammates\">Good teammates </a></li><li><a href=\"https://pliao39.com/legibility-and-software\">Legibility</a></li><li><a href=\"https://pliao39.com/where-are-you-from\">Where are you from?</a></li></ul><p>Many of the posts are just examples of me taking notes in public, and then there are some articles that I wrote just to meet my quota and don't intend to see again. </p><p>But regardless, the foundation is forming.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>This practice is unlikely to be sustainable over the long run, but it's having a strong effect.

Fistfuls upon fistfuls. All in all, we had to refill the station after about 1 hour, and the reinforcements only lasted another hour or so.</p><p>Had the rules been followed, the candy reserves should have been enough for about 80 kids.

This form of simplicity has \"scaled\" the complexity curve. If information is wild, then this form of simplicity is information tamed into a mental model.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.planplusonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/The-Simplicity-on-the-Far-Side-of-Complexity_blogheader1.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>For humans, complexity is not legible, whereas simplicity is. We desire legibility, but as you can see, one form is good. The other.. is quite bad.</p><h2 id=\"complexity-legibility-and-software\">Complexity, Legibility, and Software</h2><p>Software tends towards entropy. With time, as each feature gets added, as each bug gets \"fixed\", as developers come and go, the software system inevitably becomes a mess - no matter how pristine it started.</p><p>At some point, this complexity and entropy slows the team down. The company yearns for legibility!</p><p>In Alexander's review of \"Seeing Like A State\", he describes a similar situation in 18th century Prussia:</p><blockquote>Enlightenment rationalists noticed that peasants were just cutting down whatever trees happened to grow in the forests, <em>like a chump</em>. They came up with a better idea: clear all the forests and replace them by planting identical copies of Norway spruce (the highest-lumber-yield-per-unit-time tree) in an evenly-spaced rectangular grid</blockquote><p>And then?</p><blockquote>This went poorly. The impoverished ecosystem couldn’t support the game animals and medicinal herbs that sustained the surrounding peasant villages, and they suffered an economic collapse. The endless rows of identical trees were a perfect breeding ground for plant diseases and forest fires. And the complex ecological processes that sustained the soil stopped working, so after a generation the Norway spruces grew stunted and malnourished. Yet for some reason, everyone involved got promoted, and “scientific forestry” spread across Europe and the world.</blockquote><p>Sadly, this tale does not only apply to these Enlightenment rationalists. Anyone who has worked on a software team long enough to witness a regime change might resonate with this hypothetical:</p><p>Imagine a software engineering team who is growing fast, but lacks a CTO. The previous VP of Engineering was well liked, but resigned because he wanted to live in Boulder, CO and be among the rock climbing trails. And so, someone new comes in. </p><p>In order to govern their empire, this new CTO yearns for legibility. After 7 weeks on the job, they demand that all systems be rewritten in Java 7. Because Java 8+ and functional programming is \"too hard to hire for\" (which is code for the leadership by insecurity).</p><p>On the bright side, they've decided to start small and break up the monolith into microservices - and have chosen a couple of pilot projects to start.</p><p>On the downside, these projects will be led by the Council of The CTO, which is comprised of a few senior engineers the new CTO has spent the last 7 weeks hiring. </p><p>You can't help but notice that this collection of senior \"talent\" bears striking resemblance to Wormtongue whispering sweet sycophantic yes-man, yes-boss, reality-ignoring stupidity into the ears of the CTO. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/85070803/we-must-rewrite-in-java-7-my-lord.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><em>Note, however, there is a difference between King Theoden and our hypothetical CTO: the causal relationship of incompetence doesn't run in the direction of powerful brownnosers leading to degraded leadership skills. Rather, it's ego-centric leadership leading to a festering entourage of way-too-highly-compensated henchmen, who reign for a brief moment of time.</em></p><p>And thus, we begin yet another \"High Modernist\" attempt at enforcing top down, rectangular grid, central planning on a software codebase. We all know how this disaster ends. The complexity wins, and the floundering CTO and their Council has found themselves thrashing about in <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/themythicalmanmonth/tmmm/tar-pit\">the tar pit</a>. </p><p>Sigh, one should not dive head first into the tar pit - it's best to \"lay some boardwalks across the tar\".</p><h2 id=\"boardwalks-for-complexity\">Boardwalks for Complexity</h2><p>So if hiring Mr. CTO isn't the way to go, how can we balance our need for legibility without causing an ecological meltdown?</p><p>I can't answer this conclusively, but I'm offering \"boardwalks\" - some tools that might help this dangerous traversal.</p><h3 id=\"1-archaeologists-not-architects\">1) Archaeologists not Architects</h3><p>When it comes to reining in the complexity of software, I believe that there is one truth we are trying to optimize for. It comes from the line in \"<a href=\"https://www.csc.gov.sg/articles/how-to-build-good-software\">How to Build Good Software</a>\":</p><blockquote>The main value in software is not the code produced, but the knowledge accumulated by the people who produced it.</blockquote><p>In many cases, the root cause of disastrous rewrites simply occurs because the people who wrote the first version of the software did not leave a legible trail for the people behind them. In fact, it's often the case that the trail blazers/code cowboys and cowgirls who wrote the code never even understood the domain themselves, simply brute-forcing, fire fighting, bug squashing, and praying their way to something that was Good Enough™.</p><p>But the onus of legibility is never on the original crew, the onus is on the team doing the rewrite. This squad must understand the situation on the ground before attacking. Whether or not the original crew left breadcrumbs is irrelevant. They left code and that, sadly, is Your King. </p><p>At this point, you want archaeologists and anthropologists, not architects. Anyone who starts architecting before digging is preparing to swim in the tar pit.</p><h3 id=\"2-clean-code-and-legibility\">2) Clean Code and Legibility</h3><p>At its core, I believe clean code is simply code that is \"legible to humans\". If code is quickly understood by the engineers on your team, and can be modified safely, then I believe it is \"clean\".</p><p>I like this concept because it shows us that legibility CAN be imposed on something, without sacrificing correctness and robustness. In fact, clean code is often more correct and more robust - because the abstractions are in place to add optimizations over time.</p><p>The concept here is that legibility can be achieved at the micro level if we strive for clean code. If new hires can make progress on your code base without much polite complaining, then your code is reasonably clean (i.e. they don't say things like \"The code's pretty good, although A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K... has slowed me a bit down this week\"). If they're complimenting the codebase, then you know it's clean (the joke here is that this doesn't happen).</p><p>So micro-legibility is great and all, but we're really looking for something bigger. Where else can we increase legibility in software without sacrificing correctness?</p><h3 id=\"3-the-micro-in-microservices\">3) The micro in Microservices</h3><p>As software systems get more complex, they often face \"The Decision\". That's the point in a startup's lifecycle where there are just too many engineers - and not everyone can coexist happily under one roof.</p><p>How a company negotiates the transition to microservices is important. Having seen a failed attempt at this, I have increased conviction that the right way to think about microservices (as with most new things, really) is to start super small.</p><p>Here's how you might start:</p><ul><li>Start a new feature as its own tiny microservice (typically when you need new resources and endpoints, not when you're adding fields to an existing resource)</li><li>Refactor tiny, stateless portions of your application into Serverless functions (anything that uses ImageMagick is a fantastic example - thumbnail generation, image resizing, etc. <a href=\"https://www.serverless.com/learn/use-cases/\">Here's some more</a>)</li></ul><p>In these cases, it's possible to chip away at pieces of the monolith while still preserving most of the hard earned \"learnings\" of the legacy code. That's because the ambitions are small. This avoids the hubris of diving straight into the tar pit.</p><h3 id=\"4-the-strangler\">4) The Strangler </h3><p>If your ambitions are not small, and you want to finish this rewrite before the next promotion cycle - then good luck, I can't help you. But if you're open to the idea that these things will take time, let's consider, The Strangler.</p><p>I've written about this in detail <a href=\"https://softwarementor.substack.com/p/9-the-strangler-pattern\">before</a>, and I don't wish to rehash everything from then. That said, let me pluck a few choice quotes so you don't have to redirect off this page:</p><blockquote>Thankfully, Azure has put out a great description of the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/strangler\">Strangler Pattern</a>... Here’s their illustration of how to use it:</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F430262d4-a3b7-4b07-a3c9-729a0e695276_1833x552.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><blockquote>The key point to note is that in this case, the Strangler is a Facade, a  wrapper around both the legacy and “modern” systems. This differs  slightly from Martin Fowler’s formulation. For Fowler, there isn’t  necessarily a Strangler Facade, just a legacy and modern system that  take different amounts of traffic.</blockquote><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>Legibility is a fascinating idea, especially in the context of complexity. And there's one thing I haven't really spoken about yet, which is human systems that are too complex tend to become brittle. Was the Fall of Rome simply the Empire reaching a tipping point of complexity?</p><p>And thus, we reach for legibility, not necessarily because we like it and want to look like geniuses, but sometimes, because we have to.</p><p>I don't have any answers, but I have offered \"boardwalks\" that you can place atop the tar pit:</p><ol><li>Favor <strong>Archaeologists</strong>, not Architects</li><li>Strive for <strong>Clean Code</strong> and Legibility</li><li>Put the micro in <strong>Micro</strong>services</li><li>Use the <strong>Strangler</strong></li></ol><p>Whether or not we can achieve legibility in software is not something I can answer.

Is an an-ion this way, or that way?’</blockquote><p>-Richard Feynman, <em>Surely You Must Be Joking, Mr. Feynman</em></p><p>I love this quote because it hits upon some of my favorite themes:</p><ul><li>Go slow, then go fast</li><li>Understand the fundamentals</li></ul><p>But my favorite aspect of this quote is Feynman's willingness to look dumb. Here, he is probing for seemingly obvious facts, and if this was your first encounter with him, you might start to think this Mr. Feynman wasn't all he's been cracked up to be.</p><p>Yet sure enough, Feynman's mastery of the basics paid dividends:</p><blockquote>[L]ater, when the guy's in the middle of a bunch of equations, he'll say something and I'll say, \"Wait a minute! There's an error! That can't be right!\" The guy looks at his equations, and sure enough, after a while, he finds the mistake and wonders, \"How the hell did this guy, who hardly understood at the beginning, find that mistake in the mess of all these equations?\"</blockquote><h2 id=\"the-willingness-to-look-dumb\">The Willingness to Look Dumb</h2><p>The advice here is not \"be willing to look dumb\". </p><p>Rather, you should think of \"the willingness to look dumb\" as a wager - and like all speculative endeavors with probabilistic returns, there's a chance that you will come out on top, and one where you might tank your confidence into <a href=\"https://medium.com/incerto/the-logic-of-risk-taking-107bf41029d3\">ruin</a>.</p><p>Feynman's willingness to look dumb, I believe, was a bet. One that he felt comfortable taking for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>A previously high level of intellectual confidence (such a small wager was relatively inconsequential)</li><li>He knew that his typical ROI from clarifying the basics was positive </li></ul><p>The fact that Feyman himself called these \"dumb questions\" shows how self aware he was. This is not the case of a socially unaware genius just bulldozing his way through life. This was someone who felt the sting of social cues.</p><p>Yet he did it anyways. And he did it repeatedly. </p><h2 id=\"when-to-look-dumb\">When to Look Dumb</h2><p>Imagine that confidence can be banked (think of it as a bank account). And then imagine that \"dumb\" questions have a price, which is paid in a small amount of confidence. </p><p>When we ask dumb questions, we take a withdrawl from that confidence bank account.</p><p>If we have a lot of confidence, then this price is trivial. Go ahead, and ask your dumb questions.</p><p>But if you do not have a lot of confidence, you can't be so nonchalant. You must determine if this question will genereate a positive yield.</p><p>So let's walk through how we can think about this.</p><p>First, let's consider the cost:</p><ul><li>Will these people remember that I asked this question <strong>in 1 month</strong>?</li><li>Will this question disrupt the flow of conversation for everyone for more than 30 seconds?</li></ul><p>If the answer is yes to either of these, then this question is relatively expensive. Think twice.</p><p>Now, let's consider the benefits:</p><ul><li>Is this question a <strong>clarifying question</strong>?</li><li>Is this question relatively <strong>fundamental</strong>?</li><li>Does the answer to this question <strong>help you participate</strong> in the conversation? That is to say, does the conversation build on top of this?</li></ul><p>If you answered yes to any of these, then there's a good chance that the ROI from asking the question will at the very least lead you to break even. In each of these, you will use the knowledge gained a few times in the future.</p><p>Here are some more considerations:</p><ul><li>Are you <strong>actively curious</strong> about the answer?</li><li>Will you <strong>use the answer to build</strong> <strong>up a mental model</strong> of how something works?</li></ul><p>If you answered yes here, asking a dumb question is almost always a good idea. You're capturing your own intellectual momentum. The answer will help you understand something better than a Google search because you're emotionally involved. </p><p>Strike when the iron is hot.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>Dumb questions can be mortifying to ask. You are trading vulnerability in the present for an unproven potential return in the future.</p><p>But building up a practice of asking questions will slowly build up your confidence. Not only that, but asking these uncomfortable questions can actually deepen your understanding.</p><p>Hell, even questions that don't make any sense can generate positive results. Consider this quote from Randall Munroe (of <a href=\"https://xkcd.com\">xkcd</a>):</p><blockquote>They say there are no stupid questions.

The medium is the message and it's not meant to be glanced at for quick recall. Thus, with the help of the SoS cohort, we've provided an accompaniment. This effort is ongoing, but the goal here is to provide a glossary of \"hard to remember\" terms paired with \"easy to grasp\" explanations.</p><h2 id=\"chapter-5-replication\">Chapter 5 - Replication</h2><p>Single Leader Replication</p><ul><li><strong>Semi-synchronous replication</strong> - A configuration of replicated databases where there is one synchronous follower, and all others are asynchronous. This means there is at least one guaranteed in sync follower, without a terrible performance penalty. It's a popular configuration</li><li><strong>Failover</strong> - the process of picking a new leader once a leader has failed. Complications may arise, such as the old leader rejoining after the new leader is chosen (in which case, the old leader's stale data is discarded, and starts following) and <strong>split brain</strong> (where multiple nodes think they're the leader. One of them eventually wins out)</li></ul><p>Types of Replication Logs</p><ul><li><strong>Statement Based replication</strong> - In this form of replication, statements are streamed to followers as is. It is conceptually easy and compact, but problems may arise when statements use things like rand() and now() and autoincrement. </li><li><strong>Write ahead log replication</strong> - this form of replication is done by sending the on-disk representation deltas to followers (recall that the write ahead log is used in crash recovery purposes). This may be a problem if upgrading database versions, but the greater principle is that by coupling the replication log with its representation, you can encounter difficulties (as you loose a degree of flexibility)</li><li><strong>Logical log (or row based) replication</strong> - describes the exact changes that are happening on each row. Avoids the problems of statement based (i.e. now and rand) and write ahead (coupling). Similar to write ahead log, this can result in a lot of data streamed to followers</li><li><strong>Trigger based replication</strong> - basically running some code to run some custom replication logic</li></ul><p>Replication Lag</p><ul><li><strong>Replication lag</strong> - the phenomenon where a follower is significantly behind the leader, such that someone who reads from the follower might observe a database that is in an old state.</li><li><strong>Read-after-write Consistency</strong> -  when you write to a database you would expect the change to be there upon subsequent reads. This consistency makes that guarantee</li><li><strong>Monotonic Reads</strong> - If several replicas are utilized, we can encounter a situation where some replicas are more behind than others. In such cases, read requests from replica to replica will look like we’re jumping around in time (possibly back in time). Monotonic reads are a guarantee which prevent such jumping around in time</li><li><strong>Consistent Prefix Reads</strong> - If there are two requests A and B, and B depends upon A, then we want to make sure no one sees B, unless they can also see A. This is a causal relationship, and the term “consistent prefix reads” simply means this causal ordering is maintained.</li></ul><p>Leaderless Replication</p><ul><li><strong>Read repair</strong> - When a client reads a value from multiple nodes and detects a stale value from one of the nodes, they will then write back the correct value to the node that contained the wrong value.</li><li><strong>Anti-entropy process</strong> - a background daemon that runs on some datastores that will persistently look for differences in data between replicas and restore them to a consistent state.</li><li><strong>Quorum</strong> -  a subset of a cluster that must be in agreement for a decision to be recognized. For Leaderless systems (the Dynamo family of databases), this is w + r &gt; n</li><li><strong>w + r &gt; n</strong> - this inequality is a rather sneaky way to guarantee fresh reads. It states that if there are n nodes in a cluster, then the number of nodes that must be written to is w, and the nodes that must be read from is r. If this inequality holds, then ever read will contain at least one of the fresh writes due to <strong>an inevitable overlap</strong>. Clever</li><li><strong>Last write wins</strong> - a very destructive way to handle concurrent writes, but is conceptually easy to remember as the name describes it perfectly: the last write to the DB should win. Used by Cassandra and optionally by Riak. (<em>Note on Cassandra</em>: <em>Because Cassandra uses this strategy, it is recommended to make each write operation to Cassandra with a UUID and treat the entry as immutable. This is similar to a log, or event sourcing</em>)</li><li><strong>\"Happens Before\" relationships </strong>- if we handle concurrent writes with care, we need to keep track of happens before relationships. This is typically done with version vectors</li></ul><h2 id=\"chapter-6-partitioning\">Chapter 6 - Partitioning</h2><ul><li><strong>Hot Spot</strong> - a partition receiving a unfairly high amount of load, e.g. it receives much more queries than other partitions. The presence of hot spots are antithetical to the goal of partitioning, which is to <em>evenly </em>distribute data and query load across a set of nodes.</li><li><strong>Secondary Index</strong> - an index that utilizes some other information other than the primary key. The keys in a secondary index are not necessarily unique, unlike a primary index.</li><li><strong>Document-partitioned Secondary Index</strong> - each partition maintains its own secondary index for its own data. Writing to the database in this case only requires that you interact with the partition containing the document you are writing to; however this complicates read queries as you must perform scatter/gather</li><li><strong>Scatter/gather</strong> - involves sending a particular query to all partitions (the scatter) and combining the returned results (the gather). This method can make read queries on secondary indices expensive.</li><li><strong>Term-partitioned Secondary Index</strong> - Instead of each partition maintaining its own secondary index, a global index is created covering the data in all partitions and is itself partitioned by term (or hash of the term). This makes reads more efficient, but writing to a document may affect different partitions of the global index.</li></ul><h3 id=\"a-note-on-rebalancing-partitions\">A note on \"rebalancing partitions\"</h3><p>Instead of thinking of this as rebalancing partitions, a better way is to think of mapping keys to partitions, and then partitions to nodes.</p><p>The idea here is to create the partition abstraction that is NOT 1-1 to nodes. This provides flexibility.</p><p>We can define partitions as ranges over the keys (if they’re naturally ranges) or over the hashes of keys (if we’re using hashed keys). Mod N is bad because changes to N cause a lot of partition changes. Once we’ve sliced out P partitions, we can assign them to the N nodes. Generally, P &gt;&gt; N and the assignment of the P partitions to the N nodes is kept in some consensus system. More capable machines can own more partitions than less capable ones and addition of new machines can “steal” partitions from other machines.<br><br>Partitions can be dynamically determined too. If there are more nodes, we can choose strategies (e.g. smaller ranges) so that there are more partitions and keep partitions small.</p><h3 id=\"a-note-on-routing-to-the-correct-partition\">A note on routing to the correct partition</h3><p>Supposing we have selected a partitioning scheme (e.g. hash or range keys), how things are routed depends on where the routing information can be: </p><ul><li>with the client</li><li>with some intermediary</li><li>or with the final destination</li></ul><p>If the client has full awareness of the destinations, it can send requests directly to the correct destination. Sometimes, there are many clients or the clients don’t have full visibility into the destinations. An intermediary like a routing proxy could route to the right place. Otherwise, destinations can function as intermediaries when they receive requests destined for a partition that they’re not responsible for. Some systems are a hybrid of these routing strategies. In all cases, the router must be aware of the possible destinations or at least the next hop and that may require use of a membership system that is typically a consensus system.</p>","comment_id":"5f9a3aa219c6bb1748406420","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1524639064490-254e0a1db723?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-10-29T03:44:34.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-10-29T04:41:12.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-10-29T04:38:53.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"A glossary of \"hard to remember\" terms from Designing Data Intensive Applications","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"tags":[{"id":"5f9a475b19c6bb1748406554","name":"engineering","slug":"engineering","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2368/tag/engineering/"}],"primary_tag":{"id":"5f9a475b19c6bb1748406554","name":"engineering","slug":"engineering","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2368/tag/engineering/"},"url":"http://localhost:2368/ddia-glossary/","excerpt":"A glossary of \"hard to remember\" terms from Designing Data Intensive Applications","reading_time":5,"access":true,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null},"168-hours":{"id":"5f98bf7519c6bb17484062bb","uuid":"06ca728d-6ce2-4297-8553-47c1d3fc192a","title":"168 Hours","slug":"168-hours","html":"<p>I started tracking my time in 15 minute intervals. </p><p>Previously, I had skimmed through a book by Laura Vanderkam called \"Off the Clock\" which recommended this practice, and like I do with all good advice, I took it to heart and promptly forgot about it.</p><p>Until last week, when the same mortal fears which drove me to pick up \"Off the Clock\" in the first place guided me back.

I can see where I waste time (I spent half an hour getting upset at Uber Eats last week, which resulted in no refund and lots of frustration) and adjust</li><li><strong>Tracking encourages intention</strong> - This goes hand in hand with optimization, but once you see how you're spending your time, you start asking \"how can I spend this better?\". Not necessarily in terms of how can I get more out of it, but simply, \"did I have a week well spent?\". </li></ul><p>So to recap - I'm <strong>more present</strong> with how I spend my idle item, I'm <strong>less likely to jump</strong> on a task (so long as it gets done in the week), I can <strong>optimize the micro</strong>, and <strong>strategize the macro</strong>.</p><p>All of these were previously goals I wanted, but adopting this practice has given me a way to tackle them all.</p><h2 id=\"the-practice\">The Practice</h2><p>For time tracking, I use a copy of Laura Vanderkam's 168 hour worksheet (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AwIuqaXfZ8fz2y3i5Mcm8d9CdsYLVn--FbU8v70pORU/edit#gid=653777042\">link to her Google Sheets template</a>). I've added some conditional formatting so there's some color and personalization (which increases my sense of investment in this worksheet):</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/168_worksheet_personalization.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Added some color\"></figure><p>When I'm at my computer, I make entries about once an hour:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/168_retroactive_entries.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"What the entries look like\"></figure><p>When I leave my computer, I'll come back in 2-3 hours and try my best to fill in what I did for that chunk of time. </p><p>Sometimes a 15 minute block will contain multiple items. Vanderkam mentions that she often records all of them, separated by commas. I don't - some items simply get lost in the sands of time.</p><p>Sometimes, I can't remember what I did and I'll simply write \"???\".</p><p>Some tasks also don't like up perfectly with the 15 minute increments (although I find myself intentionally lining up tasks so they wrap up in 15 minutes).</p><p>It's not perfect, but that's not the point. Just having rough record of my time is sufficiently useful for me to get all the benefits I outlined above.</p><p>And forcing myself to make entries (with a lot of copy paste), just makes me so much more aware of how this entry stacks up against the greater \"portfolio of investments\" I'm making this week.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>Over the coming weeks, I'm sure I'll learn much more about this practice - for example, if it's valuable to do for more than just a few weeks.</p><p>But for now, I wanted to write about it and encourage everyone to consider it. The benefits are plentiful, the implementation is straightforward - and all I think you need is a push.</p><p>So check out Laura Vanderkam's time tracking templates (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AwIuqaXfZ8fz2y3i5Mcm8d9CdsYLVn--FbU8v70pORU/edit#gid=653777042\">15 min blocks</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1exRsksuzYbni4JTibsxWFCZUjQdu1608Zc4teb-ewhE/edit?usp=sharing\">30 min blocks</a>), make a copy, change the colors and get tracking!</p>","comment_id":"5f98bf7519c6bb17484062bb","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1495364141860-b0d03eccd065?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-10-28T00:46:45.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-10-28T03:41:33.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-10-28T03:33:36.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"I started tracking my time in 15 minute intervals.

While the tone is pessimistic, I think everyone working in technology should read it.</p><p>I'll summarize and add my analysis to the talk in this post, but seriously, you should go read the transcript.</p><p>The talk is centered around 5 thoughts on technological change (some I've rephrased):</p><ol><li>\"All technological change is a trade-off\"</li><li>The benefits of technology are not evenly distributed</li><li>If the medium is the message, then technology changes the message</li><li>\"Technological change is not additive; it is ecological\"</li><li>Technology tends \"to become mythic\"</li></ol><h2 id=\"1-all-technological-change-is-a-trade-off\">1) \"All technological change is a trade-off\"</h2><p>The idea here is that technology is a double edge sword - it is a tool that cuts both ways.</p><p>Postman starts by asking us to consider the printing press.</p><blockquote>The printing press gave the Western world prose, but it made poetry into an exotic and elitist form of communication. It gave us inductive science, but it reduced religious sensibility to a form of fanciful superstition. Printing gave us the modern conception of nationhood, but in so doing turned patriotism into a sordid if not lethal emotion. We might even say that the printing of the Bible in vernacular languages introduced the impression that God was an Englishman or a German or a Frenchman</blockquote><p>What Postman is leading us to recognize is that technology does not care about culture. And in fact, it is often destructive of culture. Is this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction\">creative destruction</a>, or simply a bankruptcy of wisdom?</p><h2 id=\"2-the-benefits-of-technology-are-not-evenly-distributed\">2) The benefits of technology are not evenly distributed</h2><p>In this idea, Postman mentions that technology brings great benefit to some, but inflicts harm to others.</p><p>By way of analogy, he asks us to consider the blacksmith at the dawn of the automobile. Many believed the automobile would bring them more business, but alas, that is not what happened. The automobile was the beginning of the obsolescence of blacksmiths.</p><p>When it comes to computers, Postman predicted that the winners of the computer revolution would be large scale organizations like the military, airlines, and banks. But most people would bear some degree of harm.</p><blockquote>These people have had their private matters made more accessible to powerful institutions. They are more easily tracked and controlled; they are subjected to more examinations, and are increasingly mystified by the decisions made about them. They are more than ever reduced to mere numerical objects. They are being buried by junk mail. They are easy targets for advertising agencies and political institutions </blockquote><p>Indeed, if we look at his warnings, they have played out:</p><ul><li>Tracking</li><li>Advertisements</li><li>Control</li></ul><p>This reminds me of the <a href=\"https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-cantillon-effect-why-wall-street\">Cantillon Effect</a>, which is the phenomenon where newly printed money will first increase inequality before leading to uniform inflation. Quite simply, the new money tends to be received by the rich. The rich will spend this unearned inheritance and cause prices to rise. Eventually, this money will find its way to the poor, but not before they have had to endure a period of higher prices without seeing higher wages.</p><h2 id=\"3-if-the-medium-is-the-message-then-technology-changes-the-message\">3) If the medium is the message, then technology changes the message</h2><p>Postman cites Marshall McLuhan: \"The medium is the message\".</p><p>He describes how writing first shifted the importance away from memory:</p><blockquote>But in a culture with writing, such feats of memory are considered a waste of time, and proverbs are merely irrelevant fancies. The writing person favors logical organization and systematic analysis, not proverbs</blockquote><p>And subsequent technology changes after writing:</p><blockquote>The telegraphic person values speed, not introspection. The television person values immediacy, not history</blockquote><p>And finally, this brings us to computers:</p><blockquote>And computer people, what shall we say of them? Perhaps we can say that the computer person values information, not knowledge, certainly not wisdom. Indeed, in the computer age, the concept of wisdom may vanish altogether</blockquote><p>While that's harsh, it's very true that the Internet has changed how we write (shorter pieces, otherwise the visitor bounces - with simple diction). Has it eroded our concept of wisdom?</p><p>It's a useful question to ponder.</p><h2 id=\"4-technological-change-is-not-additive-it-is-ecological\">4) \"Technological change is not additive; it is ecological\"</h2><p>Like Pandora's Box, once you've opened the door to a new technology, there's no going back - and it permeates through all of life.</p><p>This point is all about the idea that because technology touches everything, it's extremely hard to predict the higher order effects.</p><p>But because we can't predict the higher order effects, we need to be hyper vigilant. Otherwise, the capitalists who create the systems won't be worrying about their impact on the culture:</p><blockquote>The radicals who have changed the nature of politics in America are entrepreneurs in dark suits and grey ties who manage the large television industry in America. They did not mean to turn political discourse into a form of entertainment. They did not mean to make it impossible for an overweight person to run for high political office. They did not mean to reduce political campaigning to a 30-second TV commercial. All they were trying to do is to make television into a vast and unsleeping money machine. That they destroyed substantive political discourse in the process does not concern them.</blockquote><p>Postman is talking about television, but you could easily see him talking about Facebook and Surveillance Capitalism today.</p><h2 id=\"5-technology-tends-to-become-mythic\">5) Technology tends \"to become mythic\"</h2><p>This last point is simply to say that very quickly, technology becomes something of a given - that's just the way things are. But the truth is, technology and the use of technology is a cage devised for all of us by those who seek to profit.</p><p>Postman discusses how we take the alphabet for granted:</p><blockquote>I have on occasion asked my students if they know when the alphabet was invented. The question astonishes them. It is as if I asked them when clouds and trees were invented. The alphabet, they believe, was not something that was invented. It just is. </blockquote><p>And likens it to other forms of technology:</p><blockquote>It is this way with many products of human culture but with none more consistently than technology. Cars, planes, TV, movies, newspapers—they have achieved mythic status because they are perceived as gifts of nature, not as artifacts produced in a specific political and historical context</blockquote><p>This is dangerous - to accept things the way they are, as opposed to question whether we can have something better.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>Even though the talk was from 1998, it might be more relevant now than ever. With \"Big Tech\" under scrutiny, the tide has truly shifted and we're all beginning to ask \"has all this technology truly made our lives better?\".</p><p>I personally believe that technology will march on, whether we like it or not. New mediums of expression will continue to arise. And we will soon be at the boundary of \"supassing\" humanity, as gene editing and AI mature with each passing month. That's a scary thought.</p>","comment_id":"5f9773b719c6bb1748406125","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1451187580459-43490279c0fa?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-10-27T01:11:19.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-10-27T05:29:58.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-10-27T04:27:00.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"Neil Postman warns us that technology is disruptive - not of industries, but of our culture and our wisdom.

I'm feeling it again, so here's a reprint:</em></p><h3 id=\"2020-08-02\">2020-08-02</h3><p>Earlier this week, I experienced a sharp turn in my energy levels. Monday and Tuesday were great. Then, something happened on Wednesday night.</p><p>My ability to think abstract thoughts and generate any semblance of creative work left my brain. I felt like Cinderella when the clock struck 12, or that movie Limitless when the Adderall++ pills began to wear off. The magic faded away and thereafter, I was forced to welcome the reign of tiredness.</p><p>This happens to me a lot. I seem to operate in two forms, one in which ideas and productivity comes naturally - and another in which  everything is a struggle.

Wednesday was the bust in my boom and bust energy cycle, and the last few days, things went from bad to worse, and here I am trying to re-invest in the fundamentals to get myself firing on all cylinders again.</p><h3 id=\"addendum-on-2020-10-25\">Addendum on 2020-10-25</h3><p>This week, I felt like I was riding some upward momentum - and then, quite suddenly, I started to feel the wheels coming off. I noticed my average hours of sleep were falling, which was accompanied by some pain in my knees during my morning runs.</p><p>And it all caught up to me on Friday in a crash.</p><p>The good news is that I think the underlying fundamentals are strong.

It was of Josh Waitzkin being interviewed by Tim Ferriss at the Sohn Conference in 2019:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4r6gr7uytQA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>Here are my takeaways</p><h2 id=\"finish-strong\">Finish Strong</h2><p>Waitzkin shares that he was once skiing with Olympic gold medalist Billy Kidd when Kidd turned to him and asked  \"Do you know what the three most important turns of the ski run are?\".</p><p>Most skiiers might say the middle turns. These are often done at the highest speed and greatest intensity.</p><p>But that's not it. Kidd said the most important turns are the last three before you get on the lift. </p><p>People tend to get sloppy towards the end, but those three turns are what your body is subconsciously internalizing as you ride the ski lift back up.</p><p>It's true in martial arts - when Josh was practicing Taichi push hands (he became a world champion), he would always finish strong and making sure to execute the technique as well as he could before signing off for the day</p><blockquote>The last thing you do is what is going to burn most deeply over night. Harnessing unconscious learning is a huge part of what I do</blockquote><p>This story is fascinating because it reminds me of a video I watched of why Steph Curry is successful. The narrator was a coach at Kobe's Nike Skills Academy and Steph was a camper. He mentioned that Steph was the most impressive kid there, because he was \"meticulous\" with everything he did. But here's a gem:</p><blockquote>Probably the most impressive thing that he did - as soon as the workout was over, he would not leave the court until he swished - SWISHED - five free throws in a row. Do you know how hard that is?</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rxsdiusm1NQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>There's great wisdom in making your subconscious work for you. Steph - whether he knew it it or not- had found a way to channel it.</p><h2 id=\"your-miq-and-your-subconscious\">Your MIQ and Your Subconscious </h2><p>Waitzkin introduces the concept of a MIQ or Most Important Question. He says you want to end your day thinking about your MIQ, then you want to relax, and in the morning, brainstorm on the MIQ as the first thing you do. Absolutely no Twitter, no phone use - you want to be \"preinput\" as Waitzkin mentions. </p><p>The key is to leverage your subconscious - you want your subconscious to be working on the problem as you sleep.</p><p>He cites how Earnest Hemingway would leave his work with something \"left to write\" - whether that was midsentence, midparagraph, or something unfinished.</p><p>So what does this look like? It might be something like this:</p><ul><li>MIQ: Do I intuitively feel like the VP of Sales candidate is an ethical person?</li><li>Relax: Stop thinking about the MIQ and go grab a glass of wine with your partner. (The art of letting go is important he says)</li><li>Morning: Before your mind gets influenced by any other source, start writing/brainstorming about the MIQ</li></ul><p>The idea of priming your subconscious is what I think Paul Graham was talking about in his essay \"<a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html\">The Top Idea in Your Mind</a>\"</p><blockquote>I think most people have one top idea in their mind at any given time.  That's the idea their thoughts will drift toward when they're allowed to drift freely.  And this idea will thus tend to get all the benefit of that type of thinking, while others are starved of it.</blockquote><p>So finishing your day with your MIQ primed is just another way of feeding your top idea to your subconscious for processing. Jumping on it as the first thing you do in the morning is a great way to see if your subconscious has generated any insights. Maybe not, but you need to give it a chance.</p><p>And to pick your MIQ - Waitzkin has this little gem of a quote:</p><blockquote>Most great thinkers are like a knife through butter, and then they get stuck</blockquote><p>That \"stuck\" is your MIQ.</p><h2 id=\"extreme-relaxation-and-then-extreme-focus\">Extreme Relaxation and then Extreme Focus</h2><p>I'll let these quotes mostly speak for themselves.</p><p>Imagine watching a boxer in slow motion:</p><blockquote>If you watch a great boxer, the relaxation before a strike is delivered is incredible</blockquote><p>How do you apply this idea of extreme relaxation combined with extreme focus?</p><blockquote>Most people in high stress decision making industries are always operating at this simmering six or four. As opposed to the unduluation between just deep relaxation and being at a ten. And being at a ten is millions times better than just being at a six</blockquote><p>The idea is if you feel \"always on\", you're capping your energy such that your maximum is a \"simmering six\". Waitzkin mentions the importance of being able to operate at a \"ten\" - and that can make all the difference.</p><p>In my own life, I really think this is true - especially in times of judgement. When you are designing a system or deciding what kind of project to create, you want to make the decision when you're at a \"ten\". If you're in execution mode, just pure labor, you can probably hang out at that \"simmering six\".</p><h2 id=\"self-expression\">Self Expression</h2><p>Just read these quotes and soak in the wisdom. May they inspire you</p><blockquote>\"It's very easy to follow the mental models of others, or follow the paths of others. And it's usually disastrous\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"From my perspective the goal is unobstructed self expression. So first we have to understand what self expression is and who we are as a learner. We have to embrace every element of our funk and build around it.\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"It's such a beautiful thing that happens\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"And I think a big part of being all in on something, and falling in love with something so deeply that you're just eating it, breathing it, you're sleeping it. You wake up in the morning wanting to do it. You want to train at it. Being just on fire, stoked out of your mind on the thing. It's this feeling that you're expressing yourself through what you're doing.\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"If you're a writer, or a chess player, or writing books and doing brilliant podcasts. If you feel like you're expressing the core of your being, then it's beautiful.\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"If I'm doing it in a way that someone tells me versus a way that expresses the core of my being - it's a different world.\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"It's not so easy to get to know ourselves. But I think the art of introspection. Psychologically. Somatically. Is one of the most important that we can take on\"</blockquote><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>I believe we are not getting enough out of subconscious minds.</p><p>I like to say that when I am solving a problem, my strategy is mostly to \"prime my brain\" with all of the facts and algorithms/strategies and just sit there until I have an insight. Of course, I might be doing work like writing down facts or rearranging facts, but what I'm really doing is I'm just playing with the details such that my subconscious can find the solution.</p><p>What I love about what Waitzkin talks about is this deep respect for the subconscious, as well as the deep sense of self expression. Some things cannot be \"logicked\". I do not believe you can truly rationalize your way to insights, no matter how logical they appear after the fact.

I love meetings.</p><p>Let's be clear - I hate bad meetings - perhaps more than I love good meetings. But I <em>do</em> love good meetings. They can alter trajectories,  bring clarity, and energize a team. </p><p>So, how do we have good meetings?</p><h2 id=\"mindset\">Mindset</h2><p>The first thing I think people get wrong about meetings is their mindset. </p><p>Meetings are often seen as a place for \"discussion\" or knowledge sharing - but that's too dull for my liking.</p><p>I like to think of meetings as a team sport, where the objective is to agree upon a direction that gets the team fired up and to pair that direction with crystal clear next steps. We want to leave the room energized and ready to execute.</p><p>Let's draw an analogy between basketball and meetings:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Basketball</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Meetings</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">One basketball</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">One speaker</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Scoring</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Making decisions or Identifying action items</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Passing</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Asking questions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Setting screens</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Mentioning overlooked facts/details</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I could probably stretch this analogy a little bit more, but I think we're pretty close to its breaking point already.</p><p>But the idea here is that if you view meetings as a team sport, you're going to stay engaged and get the most out of everyone. When that happens, we accomplish more than if we didn't work together, which is the entire freaking point of meetings.</p><p>Mindset shift - meetings are a team sport.</p><h2 id=\"preparation\">Preparation</h2><p>At Amazon, Jeff Bezos has implemented the \"weirdest meeting culture\"  for his executive team. I think it's brilliant. See the video below (starting at the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KPbKeNghRYE?t=1084\">18:04</a> mark)</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KPbKeNghRYE?start=1084&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>It starts with someone writing a six page memo:</p><blockquote>What we do is, somebody for the meeting has prepared a six page memo - a narratively structured memo - that has got real sentences, and topic sentences, and verbs and nouns. It's not just bullet points. And it lays out and it's supposed to create the context for what will then be a good discussion</blockquote><p>Then the entire team reads the memo, in silence:</p><blockquote>And then we read those memos silently in the meeting. So it's like a study hall. And we do that, everybody sits around the table. And we read silently for usually about half an hour or however long it takes us to read the document. And then we discuss it. </blockquote><p>This is done to ensure the execs have read the memo:</p><blockquote>The reason we read them in the room by the way, is because just like high school kids, executives will bluff their way through the meeting as if they've read the memo... [This way] everyone's actually read the memo, as opposed to pretending.</blockquote><p>Genius. </p><p>Most bad meetings that I've been a part of are bad because people aren't sufficiently prepared. Engineers haven't done enough work to understand what's feasible (not enough reading documentation and prototyping). Product managers haven't thought deeply about the ideal customer experience and the top customer pain points.</p><p>But when everyone is prepared and has done the \"homework\" (or is it workwork 🤔), then you have a chance of having a great meeting.</p><p>Let me use another example to see if I can drive this home (taken from <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/03/03/thomas-jefferson-meetings/\">John Cook</a>). It's about Thomas Jefferson and the first meeting regarding the founding of the University of Virginia</p><blockquote>When they gathered at that first meeting to hash things out, Jefferson made sure to show up with meticulously prepared architectural drawings, detailed budgets for construction and operation, a proposed curriculum, and the names of specific faculty he wanted to import from Europe.  No one else in the room was even remotely as prepared... </blockquote><blockquote>His purpose was strategic: to show up at the meeting with something so substantive that everyone else would have to fall back into simply proposing modifications to it</blockquote><p>So by being extremely prepared, Jefferson was able to make tremendous progress. When someone has already done the work of preparing a proposal, it's so much easier to discuss \"diffs\" from the proposal, as opposed to starting from scratch. And maybe that's why Amazon's memo strategy is so effective.</p><h2 id=\"prepare-an-agenda\">Prepare an Agenda</h2><p>Ok, so you already know this, but important things need to be repeated: prepare an agenda.</p><p>That said, you should leave room for creativity and <em>some</em> wiggle room for tangents. It's frustrating when a meeting organizer is too militant about following an agenda, but that's a million times better than not having an agenda at all.</p><p>It only takes a few minutes. Just prepare an agenda.</p><h2 id=\"take-notes\">Take Notes</h2><p>At least one person should be taking notes. If no one is taking notes, the meeting's value will have a half life of 30 minutes - no matter how good the meeting was, people will forget.</p><p>A recording is ok, but nothing beats notes. </p><p>I like processing my raw meeting notes before sending them out. I whittle down points such that they are concise, and bold every decision and action item for a quick eye scan. It only takes about 5-10 minutes to do and makes sure a great meeting doesn't go to waste.</p><h2 id=\"this-is-not-time-to-socialize\">This is not time to socialize</h2><p>If you're using meetings to socialize, then your culture is broken. Basketball players don't play games to hang out. NBA players don't discuss their favorite TV shows and books during games.</p><p>Chit chatting with your coworkers is essential for team chemistry, but it needs to be happening outside of meetings (or in the gaps before and after the meeting). Try to eat lunch together. Spend time in 1-1s to get to know each other better. Host happy hours.</p><p>But when it's time for meetings, it's time to focus. Socializing will happen later.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>These are my thoughts on meetings as of October 2020, but I bet they'll evolve over time.</p>","comment_id":"5f930abd19c6bb1748405c88","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1431540015161-0bf868a2d407?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-10-23T16:54:21.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-10-24T02:49:32.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-10-24T02:48:06.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"I'm weird.

Some of the lazier posts take just under a couple hours, and my review of \"Rewire Your Anxious Brain\" was a few days in the making and took upwards of 10 hours, including 7 yesterday.</p><p>But, like I talked about on day 1, there are ways to make it easier: using voice transcription software to \"loosen\" up your mind, sending emails to yourself from your phone - and a new tip: turn off your computer monitor and just write for 30 minutes.</p><p>The only way to keep this up is to remove your inhibitions. Curb your perfectionism. Don't start in edit mode - start in brain dump mode - and edit later. The key is to make it easy.</p><h2 id=\"you-have-a-lot-to-say\">You have a lot to say</h2><p>Here's what I wrote about in the last 10 days:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://pliao39.com/talking-to-yourself\">Talking to yourself</a> - how to make writing easier</li><li><a href=\"https://pliao39.com/combinatorial-networking\">Combinatorial Networking</a> - how to generate more value with 2nd degree connections</li><li><a href=\"https://pliao39.com/writing-as-input\">Writing as Input</a> - trying to write with less of a stick up my ass</li><li><a href=\"https://pliao39.com/start-where-you-are\">Start Where You Are</a> - a mantra I learned from a tweet on Anthony Davis</li><li><a href=\"https://pliao39.com/subconscious-emotional-memories\">Subconscious Emotional Memories</a> - how your amygdala stores memories inaccessible to your consciousness</li><li><a href=\"https://pliao39.com/where-are-you-from\">Where are you from?</a> - my FIRST ever post on being Asian American.

And that's true, many days felt like a struggle, but it turns out I had more to say than I thought.</p><h2 id=\"you-need-a-content-pipeline\">You need a content pipeline</h2><p>What I realized is that you need a content pipeline.</p><p>You need to be constantly thinking \"oh, this might be some great content\". This does a couple things. First it makes life a little more interesting as you're constantly surveying for something to turn into a post. Second, it forces you to learn better, as you only can write a post if you've thought clearly and done your research.</p><p>But the other reason you need a content pipeline - it's the same reason why companies have a backlog of things they will rarely, if ever, get to. A backlog is similar to the \"deleted scenes\" from a movie, except the items on a backlog haven't been made yet. They exist as a foil to the actual content that gets created. It's as if to say, \"I chose to write about this topic OVER every topic on the backlog.\"</p><p>That selection, of choosing the topic that you did against everything in your backlog means that you're more excited about a given topic than everything else on your list. That excitement will shine through, and make your writing better.</p><p>It's good to have options.</p><h2 id=\"very-few-people-will-read-your-stuff\">Very few people will read your stuff</h2><p>On its best day, my website had 60 visitors. This was almost entirely from Reddit, regarding a book summary I had written (about <a href=\"https://pliao39.com/books/the-boron-letters\">The Boron Letters</a>). On most days, I get single digits.</p><p>Very few people will read your stuff and that’s ok. (see the next point for why)</p><p>I’m not gonna lie, a big part of why I’m doing this is to eventually learn SEO. But right now, SEO is such a far out day dream. I have no organic clicks, no back links, and no strategy to get them. My daily visitors routinely number in the single digits, although recently I might be getting closer to 10. </p><p>I want these numbers to go up eventually, but right now, I don't really mind if they stay small for a while - the writing itself has been worth it.</p><h2 id=\"writing-enriches-your-conversations\">Writing enriches your conversations</h2><p>Simply sharing my writing with friends and family has enriched my conversations.</p><p>At work (and previously in school), I love good meetings when everyone had done the reading and came prepared with their questions, comments, and insights. </p><p>When I share my content with my friends and family, it’s like I force them to do the reading and now the conversations are primed with rich fodder to discuss.</p><p>This alone has been worth it, and is the primary reason I write. Sometimes I write with a family member in mind. Other times, it's a couple friends. But my best stuff, I want to share with someone specific - and when I do that, my writing improves (hard to run the counterfactual, so you're just gonna have to take my word for it).</p><h2 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping up</h2><p>I still have 20 days to go! But I’ve already learned a lot from the first 10. </p><p>Today was supposed to be a “mail it in” day, a cop out, but I kind of like what I have. Will probably do another one of these at day 20, and of course, another one at day 30 (look at me, thinking in terms of a content pipeline).</p>","comment_id":"5f92139719c6bb1748405baa","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1584392282358-0334b7494872?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-10-22T23:19:51.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-10-22T23:58:27.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-10-22T23:56:57.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"Today is day 10 of my 30 day writing challenge.

When you stop by the snack aisle you load up on kettle chips and double stuffed Oreos. By the time you get to the checkout, your cart is loaded with ready to eat, canned, preserved, packaged foods.</p><p>It’s never a good idea to go grocery shopping when you’re hungry.</p><p>But the mistake here isn’t the fact that you were shopping under the influence of hunger. It’s that you didn’t come with a list - you didn’t do the work before the work. The metawork.</p><p>Metawork is generally used in a negative light to refer to useless meetings and mission statement workshops. But despite office workers' disdain for corporate busywork, there is a strong relationship between metawork and the successful execution of the work that follows.</p><h2 id=\"why\">Why</h2><p>Why do we need metawork?</p><p>It’s my experience that Stephen Covey was right when he said:</p><blockquote>[A]ll things are created twice. There’s a mental or first creation, and a physical or second creation, to all things.</blockquote><p>Which sounds nice and all, but it’s the consequence of not doing this “mental” creation that puts it in perspective:</p><blockquote>We are either the second creation of our own proactive design, or we are the second creation of other people’s agendas, of circumstances, or of past habits.</blockquote><p>So consider again the case of grocery shopping. Without a list, we are subject to the arrangement of the store and the placement of items on the shelves. We are subject to our cravings at the time of shopping. We are reliant on our memory to restock our supplies of eggs or milk or bread. On different days, we will get different results.</p><p>And all too frequently, the result requires a repeat trip to the store. Do they accept returns for opened boxes of cherry strudel?</p><h2 id=\"metawork-prevents-stagnation\">Metawork Prevents Stagnation</h2><p>If you go to the gym without a workout plan, you might really break a sweat. Use a machine here, lift some weights there, maybe toss in some kettle bell swings and a few bar bell workouts. But after 3 months of doing this, there's a good chance you'll hit stagnation.</p><p>\"Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.\" Your first workout plan might get an overhaul after just the first session, but it's the commitment to a certain fitness goal which allows each workout to build on the previous one.</p><h2 id=\"imagination-is-cheap\">Imagination is Cheap</h2><p>Metawork allows you to imagine different paths before you actually walk down them. It allows you to eliminate possibilities that sound interesting before you have to pay the dear cost of execution. Metawork is a cheap way of avoiding bad outcomes.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-do-metawork\">How to do metawork</h2><p>Once you understand the importance of metawork, your philsophy towards work begins to change. You start hunting for ways to derisk projects and make the task at hand much more approachable.</p><p>For writing, this is what I do for metawork:</p><ul><li>Start with a good question (or questions) about the topic you want to explore</li><li>Turn on a tape recorder and talk to yourself</li><li>Turn off you computer monitor and just write (Optional: a shot of your beverage of choice)</li><li>Create an outline</li></ul><p>For coding, I've found the following helpful:</p><ul><li>Generate a list of questions about your unknowns</li><li>Search through documentation to find answers to those questions</li><li>Rapid prototyping to prove or disprove unknowns</li></ul><p>In both cases, metawork needs direction and the best way to start is with questions. As you answer your questions (via research or doing), you will find those answers simply lead to more questions. And more questions. Until suddenly, you hit a point where rubber meets the road. You have no more questions. </p><p>That is clarity. Now you're off to the races.</p><h2 id=\"an-example-of-metawork\">An Example of Metawork </h2><p>Today I found myself the beneficiary of metawork done well. In the morning, I spent 5 minutes thinking about a task I had been dreading and avoiding. I asked myself, “what information do I need to gather such that I can turn unknowns into knowns?”</p><p>After prototyping a little and gathering more information, it became crystal clear what needed to be done. I estimated that cumulatively, I’d need about 2.5 hours. Once I was done, I found it took 2 hours and 36 minutes. Not bad.</p>","comment_id":"5f8f5eae19c6bb1748405a5c","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580753402232-8635eb91a327?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-10-20T22:03:26.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-10-21T04:21:53.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-10-21T04:18:46.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"All things are created twice.

I hate working alone because such a large portion of my brain is dedicated to teamwork and working solo feels like under utilizing valuable resources. It's wasteful.</p><p>But today, I wanted to reflect on qualities of good teammates. Obviously, this list isn't conclusive, but I intend to elaborate on this concept with time. I expect this will be just one post of many.</p><h2 id=\"a-nose-for-value\">A Nose for Value</h2><p>It is my experience that good teammates have a sense for what is valuable work. </p><p>In basketball, people often say a player has a \"nose for the ball\" - the player happens to be in the right place at the right time. Of course, there's luck, but when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDhoYiaQ200\">Marcus Smart</a> or Jimmy Butler routinely find themselves making play after play, there's more than just luck happening. They seem to know where the ball is going to be.</p><p>Likewise, great teammates have a sense for doing work that matters. With software engineers, it's a sense for what parts of a codebase are risky - and thus, where we should double down on high quality work, testing, and documentation. It's a combination of knowing which features get used a bunch, which code paths get executed often, and what parts of the codebase need frequent updating.</p><p>Sometimes it means reworking code to get the result into a simpler state. Sometimes it means shipping out something hacky to capture team momentum and boost morale (with a cleanup task in the back of their minds). Sometimes it means spending one hour to document a process.</p><p>An average engineer will work on whatever comes their way, sometimes optimizing just to optimize. But a good teammate will work on what matters. They won't always get it right, but you can tell they're skating to where the puck is going to be.</p><h2 id=\"higher-order-value\">Higher Order Value</h2><p>Not only do good teammates have a sixth sense for value - they also understand the velocity of value.</p><p>Thinking in terms of velocity is similar to the mindset of \"it's a marathon, not a sprint\"- but deeper. In actuality, business is not a marathon. You're never done. You're building a system, a lifestyle, a philosophy that can endure. Good teammates understand why we try to introduce process into our work.</p><p>But it goes deeper than that. Good teammates can see leverage. Again, from the vantage point of software engineers, they understand the value of CI/CD pipelines. They understand the importance of short testing cycles. They understand the importance of well written libraries, and code that can be reused by many aspects of the company. They see a beautiful API and they see combinatorial leverage. They understand that not only can you produce technical debt, you can actually produce technical wealth. They can think <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611\">in platforms</a>.</p><p>There are things you can do to increase velocity and good teammates seek to make those changes.</p><p>And in fact, it goes even further. If someone understands higher order value, they start seeing the value of culture, of hiring, and the forces that shape the processes.</p><p>Remember: position -&gt; velocity -&gt; acceleration -&gt; jerk -&gt; snap -&gt; crackle -&gt; pop</p><p>Good teammates see the big picture.</p><h2 id=\"written-communication\">Written Communication</h2><p>All of the best teammates I've worked with are excellent communicators in writing. English isn't always their first language and their writing might contain grammatical blemishes (which are endearing 🧡), but after reading something they've written, you understand the point being made - and quite often, that energizes you.</p><p>Writing is important because it:</p><ul><li>Scales</li><li>Demands mastery (or the pursuit of it)</li><li>Rewards brevity</li><li>Can compound (articles can be improved over time; can be referenced in future articles too)</li></ul><p>Good teammates excel at written communication.</p><h2 id=\"intellectual-honesty\">Intellectual Honesty</h2><p>This is a quality I've come to understand from working with bad teammates. </p><p>Bad teammates frequently obscure the truth. They will often obfuscate concepts such that no one understands exactly what is going on, but they seem to say \"don't worry. Trust me, I know how this works\".</p><p>Now, trust is not a bad thing. In fact, it's a very healthy thing. But the bad thing is when trust is being used as a proxy for mastery before mastery has been demonstrated.</p><p>You'll be able to detect this if - after seemingly every conversation with someone, you leave thinking \"I don't understand what's going on\", or \"Hmm, this feels way more complicated than it is\". When you poke and prod, the person maintains the illusion of expertise, but you're still not any closer to understanding what is going on. Sometimes, the problem is that you need to learn more before it makes sense (especially if you're junior), but more often than not, you're dealing with some form of charlatan.</p><p>My rule of thumb is not to trust someone until they've explained a concept to me - in a way that is easy to follow and demonstrates knowledge that is supple and flexible. Until then, I assume I'm either dealing with an average teammate (nothing wrong about that!) or a quack (definitely someone to avoid).</p><p>Good teammates are intellectually honest. They don't try to present themselves as experts. There is no insecurity when they admit their limits. But when they talk about something they do understand, it's a \"no flex zone\" of pure knowledge transfer. You'll feel smarter, or at the very least, have a list of topics to research next. </p><p>A dangerous caveat is the previously intellectually honest teammate who has grown accustomed to feeling a sense of mastery in their old domain, but is a relative novice in their new domain. Without someone to keep them intellectually honest, they might become a charlatan to maintain the feeling of being a master. This is exceptionally dangerous. So watch out for experienced people changing domains who have an ego.</p><h2 id=\"emotional-awareness\">Emotional Awareness</h2><p>Good teammates have good emotional awareness. I think this manifests in at least one of two forms:</p><ol><li>Explicit: Honest communication of how they feel</li><li>Implicit: Highly tuned ability to read between the lines</li></ol><p>Emotional awareness is important because projects often collapse when the team cannot function effectively. People are not listening to each other. Values are out of whack. It results in people working on opposite things. One teammate might be writing a design doc. Another might be building a \"prototype\" (which they 100% intend to deploy to production). One teammate might be cleaning up code. Another might be making more messes. Chaos.</p><p>Good teammates make it clear to the team and their manager how they feel about something. Or, they understand how everyone else feels and skillfully adapt to what the team needs. In other words, they're either a little blunt (but not quite an abrasive jerk), or they're great listeners.</p><p>However, only listening and adapting is a long-term losing strategy. It might help the team in the short run, but it will eat you up inside. You'll feel bad for not expressing your thoughts and values, grow resentful, and it may impact your performance. It might not be your MO, but if you're someone who frequently prefers adaptation - start expressing your disagreements with poise and confidence: \"If I understand you correctly, you're saying X. From what I see, I believe the right conclusion is actually Y. Here are my reasons\".</p><h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2><p>I don't think I captured everything about good teammates in this article, but I like this list so far. The qualities I find important:</p><ul><li>A Nose for Value</li><li>Understanding Higher Order Value</li><li>Excellent Written Communication</li><li>Intellectual Honesty</li><li>Emotional Awareness</li></ul><p>A couple undercurrents that cut through all of these is an eye for simplification, valuing truth over ego, and seeing the big picture. </p><p>But let me add one more thing before we go - in addition to all of the above, good teammates seem to experience great joy when the team succeeds.</p><p>Like I mentioned to above, one of my favorite parts of playing basketball was giving out high fives. I think another great quality of good teammates is they love to create situations where everyone is high fiving. That might actually be the best measure of team health that I can think of. The number of high fives between members of a team.</p><p>🙌</p>","comment_id":"5f8dbbd319c6bb1748405774","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1561862755-10ad7b1e9b0c?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-10-19T16:16:19.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-10-19T18:39:45.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-10-19T18:30:04.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"Working on a good team is a joyful.

To me, the subconscious was a single, black box. But what this book helped me realize is that within this black box, there are many components - and the Amygdala is one.</p><p>The most startling fact about the Amygdala is that not only does it <em>trigger</em> the physiological response of “fight or flight”, it also <em>stores</em> emotional memories. These emotional memories are entirely inaccessible to our conscious, thinking mind.</p><h2 id=\"an-experiment\">An Experiment</h2><p>The existence of emotional memories has been known for a long time. In 1911, Édouard Claparède conducted an experiment on one of his patients who had lost her ability to form new memories.</p><p>As the book says:</p><blockquote>One day her physician performed a little experiment (one that wouldn’t be ethical by today’s standards). When he reached out to shake her hand, he stuck her hand with a pin he’d hidden in his palm. The next day, when the woman saw the doctor extend his hand, she quickly withdrew her hand in fear. When asked why she refused to shake his hand, she couldn’t offer an explanation. In addition, she reported that she had no memory of seeing the doctor before. She had no cortex-based memory of an event that would cause her to fear the doctor; but her amygdala had created an emotional memory, and her fear was the evidence of it. (p. 33)</blockquote><p>Even though the patient couldn't form new memories, she could form new emotional memories.</p><h2 id=\"why-this-matters\">Why this matters</h2><p>Our brains are complex and when it comes to our psychology, it may not be useful to tell someone that their problems are just “in their heads” (even though that is technically true). That’s because the head is made up of multiple systems, and each must be trained via different practices. Meditation is wonderful, but it cannot dislodge a highly negative emotional memory. You do not meditate your way out of trauma (although it will probably help).</p><p>I’ll discuss anxiety much more when I finish the review of the book (along with a survey of the suggested treatments in the book), but for now - I thought it was worth admiring how complex our brains really are - and respecting the importance of emotional memories that exist beyond our consciousness.</p>","comment_id":"5f8b554b19c6bb1748405518","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559757175-5700dde675bc?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-10-17T20:34:19.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-10-17T23:19:57.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-10-17T23:18:21.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"Our brains form emotional memories that are inaccessible to our conscious minds","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"tags":[{"id":"5f8636990540858bc1b8b532","name":"anxiety","slug":"anxiety","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2368/tag/anxiety/"},{"id":"5f8b7baf19c6bb1748405597","name":"neuroscience","slug":"neuroscience","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2368/tag/neuroscience/"}],"primary_tag":{"id":"5f8636990540858bc1b8b532","name":"anxiety","slug":"anxiety","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2368/tag/anxiety/"},"url":"http://localhost:2368/subconscious-emotional-memories/","excerpt":"Our brains form emotional memories that are inaccessible to our conscious minds","reading_time":2,"access":true,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null},"start-where-you-are":{"id":"5f89f36a19c6bb1748405477","uuid":"b6ce062f-2a80-47ec-8130-b0be5b018898","title":"Start Where You Are","slug":"start-where-you-are","html":"<p>During the finals, the NBA's social media team shared this story:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Start where you are. <br>Use what you have. <br>Do what you can. <br><br>A short story on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AntDavis23?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AntDavis23</a> narrated by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DevInTheLab?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DevInTheLab</a>, and inspired by Arthur Ashe. <br><br>Game 4 ▶️ 9pm/et, ABC <a href=\"https://t.co/8gKCZUYT0R\">pic.twitter.com/8gKCZUYT0R</a></p>&mdash; NBA (@NBA) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBA/status/1313612644880916481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 6, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</figure><p>It's the story of how Anthony Davis emerged from a small, poor, no name community in the South Side of Chicago, by leaning on a philosophy called \"The Disciplined Life\":</p><blockquote>Start where you are.

A groundswell of support, of trust, of confidence followed him through the countryside.

The internet philosophers who put out pithy, insightful content (i.e. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1002103360646823936\">Naval</a>, <a href=\"https://sive.rs/hellyeah\">Derek Sivers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.akimbo.link/blog/s-6-e-6-the-overton-window\">Seth Godin</a>, et al) get there by condensing years of experience into tiny morsels for us to enjoy. They are useful primarily because the inputs are so hard earned.</p><p>And the key insight for me was that my 30 day practice shouldn’t just be about <em>generating</em> insights. Rather, I should be <em>collecting</em> more observations, links, facts, and research. Instead of focusing only on outputs, I want to enjoy gathering inputs.</p><p>If cooking is a bit like writing, then writers must also have a practice of sourcing excellent ingredients. A skilled chef might be able to transform humble ingredients into a delectable dish, but delicious inputs allow even the novice to whip up something great.</p><p>So moving forward, you’ll notice many more observations, <a href=\"https://pliao39.com/books/how-to-take-smart-notes\">notes</a>, and initial reactions to things I stumble upon. These next 27 days will be just as much about \"writing, as an output,\" as it will be about \"writing, as an input\".</p><p>Happy sourcing!</p>","comment_id":"5f8871af0540858bc1b8b77e","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591189863430-ab87e120f312?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-10-15T15:58:39.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-10-15T17:30:13.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-10-15T17:15:52.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"Day 3 of my 30 day writing challenge, and I'm making a shift in how I think about the pieces I write","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"tags":[{"id":"5f8636990540858bc1b8b531","name":"writing","slug":"writing","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2368/tag/writing/"}],"primary_tag":{"id":"5f8636990540858bc1b8b531","name":"writing","slug":"writing","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2368/tag/writing/"},"url":"http://localhost:2368/writing-as-input/","excerpt":"Day 3 of my 30 day writing challenge, and I'm making a shift in how I think about the pieces I write","reading_time":1,"access":true,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null},"combinatorial-networking":{"id":"5f8768b40540858bc1b8b53e","uuid":"8ac8a1c2-63ce-4c56-a841-e6626150acb6","title":"Combinatorial Networking","slug":"combinatorial-networking","html":"<p>On the Meyer's Briggs scale, I'm slightly more introverted than extroverted. Some might call that an <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ambivert\">ambivert</a>. But whatever I am, I know I like meeting people, but I just <em>hate</em> doing it at networking events. </p><p>In this post, I'll talk about a networking strategy I've unintentionally been using. </p><h2 id=\"second-degree-connections\">Second Degree Connections</h2><p>I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/liquid-the-soul-of-a-new-graph-database-part-1\">an article</a> last week about LinkedIn's graph database Liquid. The article was interesting to me, but not because of the database. Rather, my attention was fixated on the motivation behind why they needed to build it:</p><blockquote>t<em>he value of an <a href=\"https://economicgraph.linkedin.com/\">economic graph</a> for the average member lies mostly in their second degree network</em></blockquote><p>LinkedIn needed a proprietary graph database because they wanted to help customers get more connected with their second degree connections - apparently, the most valuable type of connection. </p><p>How large and how valuable?</p><blockquote>the set of second degree connections is typically at least 50,000 entities (e.g.,people, schools, employers). It is large enough to be diverse, but at the same time, actionable: you are one new connection away from something that can happen. In fact, your next job is probably in your second degree network.</blockquote><p>50,000 is a lot. That's much larger than a solid Twitter following. That would be a very significant mailing list. </p><p>And the fact that these connections can be made via a warm intro - that's pretty eye opening.</p><h2 id=\"combinatorial-opportunity\">Combinatorial Opportunity</h2><p>Being connected to 50,000 people indirectly vs being connected to 50,000 people directly is obviously a very different level of connection. But the point still stands - most of us are far more connected than we might think we are.</p><p>Consider, for a moment, the network expanding events that may have happened in your life:</p><ul><li>Going to college</li><li>Changing jobs</li><li>Moving to a new city </li><li>Joining a club</li><li>Attending a class after work</li></ul><p>If you look around at the people in your life, there's a very good chance they have walked extremely different paths from you. What does that mean? Well, it means your network is packed with dormant, combinatorial opportunity:</p><p>What if you asked your <strong>current coworkers</strong> to introduce you to <em>a <strong>former coworker</strong> of theirs</em> that they loved working with? And of course, you'd return the favor.</p><p>What if you asked some <strong>college friends</strong> to introduce you to <em>one person they've met <strong>since school</strong></em> that they think you'd get along well with? And again, you'd do the same.</p><p>What if you asked your new <strong>friend from cooking class</strong> (or whatever class you're taking these days) to join your <strong>college friends</strong> for a discussion on travel (or whatever people talk about these days)?</p><p>You can see where this is going - take people you know from one context, and intentionally connect them to people from another. Meanwhile, asking if they can do the same for you. There are A LOT of context combinations!</p><p>Most of us do this already, but it only happens once in a while.

This is day 1/30.</em></p><p>When you first start writing online, it can feel like everyone is watching. Yet when you check your stats, it turns out that no one is watching. Thus, getting started feels like you're writing to both everyone and no one, whichever one makes you feel worse.</p><p>The combined stage fright and lack of attention might be enough to paralyze you.</p><p>If you're freezing up, here's one strategy that can help - talk to yourself.</p><h2 id=\"talking-to-yourself\">Talking to Yourself</h2><p>When I'm stuck, I often find myself reaching for the voice transcription app, <a href=\"https://otter.ai/\">Otter</a>. Talking to yourself is the easiest way to get unstuck. It's a combination of therapy, planning and discussion.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/otter_ai_list.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Sometimes I'm feeling bad and need to work through some stuff on my mind. Other times, I'm excited and simply need to organize my thoughts. A lot of the time, it's a combination of both.</p><p>As you can see from the screenshot above, I've recently gotten in some therapy and long term planning sessions with Otter.</p><p>What's great about Otter is you can glance over the transcription and quickly jump to relevant sections. In fact, you can even search your recording (assuming the transcription quality worked for you). It's not perfect, but it saves you from having to listen to the entire recording just to find where you might have talked about Wu Tang Clan:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/otter_wu_tang_search.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"When did I mention Wu Tang again\"></figure><p>The content from talking to yourself might just be the perfect starting material for your next post. Give it a shot.</p><h2 id=\"email-yourself\">Email Yourself</h2><p>Another way I've been talking to myself is via daily morning emails composed from my phone. </p><p>I start off with a \"brain dump\" for anything on my mind, and then write a list of tasks I know I need to get to. As a productivity system, it's less than ideal, but as a way past writer's block, it's very useful. For example, this was my email today:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://pliao39.s3.amazonaws.com/talking-to-yourself_email.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Today's email to self\"></figure><p>There's something about writing on my phone that removes paralysis. Kind of like how the \"Sent from my iPhone\" signature gave people the license to have typos in their emails, writing this email from my phone relaxes me and allows me to write.</p><p>On occasion, my brain dump actually gives me topics to write about. If you look closely, today's brain dump mentions \"I need more essays on my website\" - and that ended up being the germ which became this post.</p><h2 id=\"make-it-easy\">Make it Easy</h2><p>Writing online is tricky, and there's a lot more that goes into it than simply writing and pressing publish. But it's even harder when your brain is conspiring against you to make it seem scarier than it actually is.</p><p>To get past that fear, I find that talking to myself (either via Otter or Email) is extremely effective. It gives me more ideas, puts me at ease, and overall - allows me to continue pushing forward.</p><p>If you're looking to write online, but aren't sure where to start, try talking to yourself first. You might just stumble upon an idea you're excited to share with the rest of us.</p>","comment_id":"5f85f4410540858bc1b8b29e","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556761175-129418cb2dfe?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-10-13T18:38:57.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-10-14T05:31:09.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-10-13T23:00:04.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"Writing online can be scary.

Here are three:</p><ol><li>Small Delights</li><li>Naming Matters</li><li>Real Life Virality</li></ol><h2 id=\"small-delights\">Small Delights</h2><p>When I first started using AirPods, I noticed small delights:</p><ul><li>The charging case’s magnetic snappiness</li><li>Seamless pairing</li><li>A battery indicator appearing on your iPhone when the case is opened</li><li>The “AirPods have graced your ears” sound when you put them in</li><li>Pause on removal</li><li>A tiny green light on the case that tells you everything is alright, and the smooth fade to orange when the AirPods return home to charge</li><li>Fast charging</li><li>The case’s smooth contours</li></ul><p>By themselves, none of these details is enough to win you over, but in their aggregate, AirPods deliver a cascading combo of magic moments that leave you enchanted.</p><p>Stack magic moments and customers will fall for your product.</p><h2 id=\"naming-matters\">Naming Matters</h2><p>Back in 2016, AirPods was a new product.</p><p>Let’s imagine for a moment that they were instead named Apple Buds.</p><p>Would the product still have taken off? Probably.</p><p>But doing so would have been a wasted opportunity.</p><p>A name is a young products’ most effective marketing weapons. It can evoke an emotion or feeling (Fast, Uber). It can be suggestive of a style or aesthetic (Warby Parker -&gt; Hipster). It can also hint at a product’s function.</p><p>In the case of AirPods, by channeling their own history (the iPod), and mashing that with a word that previews the product’s primary value add (Air = wireless), Apple generated an iconic name that practically explains the product.</p><ul><li>Apple Buds - Conveys, these are some earbuds from Apple</li><li>Apple AirPods - Conveys, this is some wireless device that is important for music</li></ul><p>Names matter.</p><p>How do you pick a great name? I don’t think there’s a formula you can follow (or at least, I know of none). But here are some thoughts on good names.</p><ul><li>They are easily pronounceable (for the target audience)</li><li>They hint at the products’ function</li><li>They utilize good metaphors</li><li>They have character</li></ul><p>An example of a product that has all of these:</p><ul><li>Stripe - uses a playful metaphor (the magnetic stripe on a credit card)  to hint at the product’s function</li></ul><p>Character is undoubtedly the most tricky thing here, but I think it’s often the most important. Could a story be told about how a customer uses your product? Does your product’s name fit in this story? Does it flow naturally, or does it sound misplaced? If it fits, you’ve probably got a winner.</p><p>That said, here’s a process you CAN (and probably should) follow. Pick a fallback name (Apple was a fallback name) and stick with it until something better comes along. Stripe was originally called dev/payments, until one day, they figured to call themselves Stripe. When you stumble upon a name that’s so much better than the fallback, the decision to change will be effortless.</p><h2 id=\"real-life-virality\">Real Life Virality</h2><p>AirPods are viral. They’re bright white and stand out in a crowd. Simply by using them, AirPod owners are providing Apple with free impressions on future potential customers. Every time someone walks onto the subway wearing AirPods, someone else goes “Hmm, those AirPods are everywhere”.</p><p>In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if AirPod adoption is higher in places where public transportation use is high. Or, perhaps, among cohorts of people who utilize public transportation versus those who commute in solitude (i.e. driving).</p><p>Andrew Chen recently wrote about this <a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/irl-channel/\">IRL Channel</a> of growth. It’s the phenomenon where digital products, when used in the real world, form impressions on new customers and spur further growth. This is a type of virality enjoyed by AirPods, Uber/Lyft, Amazon Echo, and others.</p><p>Is there an element of real life usage in your product? Can you accentuate it?  Red JUMP bikes stand out more than other bike share products. The neon pink Lyft mustache dashboard lights stood out more than whatever Uber was doing at that time.</p><p>Capitalize on real life virality!</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>The success of AirPods cannot be attributed to only these three elements (i.e. Apple removed the headphone jack from the iPhone!), but consider them useful tools if you’re trying to create a blockbuster product.</p><p>Happy hacking!</p>","comment_id":"5e279f808e30f03d2f93e0c0","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-01-22T01:04:00.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-09-24T21:34:18.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-01-22T01:08:13.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"Some lessons from AirPods: small delights, naming matters, real life virality","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"tags":[{"id":"5e0a7c898e30f03d2f93e036","name":"marketing","slug":"marketing","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2368/tag/marketing/"}],"primary_tag":{"id":"5e0a7c898e30f03d2f93e036","name":"marketing","slug":"marketing","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2368/tag/marketing/"},"url":"http://localhost:2368/airpods/","excerpt":"Some lessons from AirPods: small delights, naming matters, real life virality","reading_time":3,"access":true,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null},"itchier":{"id":"5e1247198e30f03d2f93e04c","uuid":"7f7ac390-40b3-42aa-a101-a7ef9b23eead","title":"Itchier","slug":"itchier","html":"<p>Successful entrepreneurs solve their own problems:</p><ul><li><strong>Shopify</strong> - Tobi wanted to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_L%C3%BCtke#Career\">sell snowboards online</a></li><li><strong>Nomad List </strong>- Pieter <a href=\"https://levels.io/product-hunt-hacker-news-number-one/\">wanted to find</a> good travel destinations for digital nomads like himself</li><li><strong>Stripe</strong> - The Collison brothers had sold their <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/auctomatic\">last business</a> and realized how difficult it was setting up online payments</li><li><strong>Basecamp</strong> - Jason’s web consultancy <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/about/story\">couldn’t find project management software</a> that stuck.

That’s the opposite of everything I’ve read about validation!</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>You see, something important needs to happen first - a change within your own mind. Instead of focusing on making money, you need to focus on making. </p><p>I was listening to <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/140-arvid-kahl-of-feedbackpanda\">an IndieHackers podcast between Courtland Allen and Arvid Kahl</a> and they both talked about the importance of finding a good market. In the past, they worked on unsuccessful businesses and didn’t want to repeat their mistakes. And thus, it was important for them to start a business with the wind behind their backs.</p><p>It’s essential advice. But notice a key detail - they had failed at previous endeavors (Arvid around the 45:00 mark, Courtland mentions his past stumbles on the podcast all the time). They were <em>already</em><strong><em> </em>makers</strong>.</p><h2 id=\"metamorphosis\">Metamorphosis</h2><p>Previously, I conflated coding ability with being a maker. They are not the same. Working at a startup doesn’t make you one either. In fact, you can be a maker without knowing how to code. A maker is someone who lives this entire process: ideation, building, <strong>shipping</strong>, engaging passionate fans, and incorporating <strong>feedback</strong>. It’s an <a href=\"https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits\">identity</a>, a habit, not a skillset. And once you do all of that, something fascinating happens:</p><p>You get \"itchier\".</p><p>You start seeing more solvable problems - you get more and<strong> better ideas</strong>. Which motivates you to build and <strong>ship</strong> and get more <strong>feedback</strong>. And when you do, you get itchier again. It's a virtuous cycle.</p><p>Is it the most efficient? Probably not. But you gotta start from somewhere.</p>","comment_id":"5e1247198e30f03d2f93e04c","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2020-01-05T20:29:13.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-09-24T21:53:04.000+00:00","published_at":"2020-01-05T20:40:33.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"Should you \"scratch your own itch\" before validating the market?","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"tags":[{"id":"5e124a1e8e30f03d2f93e09f","name":"entrepreneurship","slug":"entrepreneurship","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2368/tag/entrepreneurship/"}],"primary_tag":{"id":"5e124a1e8e30f03d2f93e09f","name":"entrepreneurship","slug":"entrepreneurship","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"http://localhost:2368/tag/entrepreneurship/"},"url":"http://localhost:2368/itchier/","excerpt":"Should you \"scratch your own itch\" before validating the market?","reading_time":2,"access":true,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null},"idea-to-product-hunt-launch":{"id":"5e01a6cf8e30f03d2f93dfe1","uuid":"e484a3d7-6b24-4255-8c99-d83f475e15ab","title":"Idea to Product Hunt Launch","slug":"idea-to-product-hunt-launch","html":"<p>Two weeks ago, I launched <a href=\"http://emojicp.com/\">Emoji cp</a> on <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/emoji-cp\">Product Hunt</a>.</p><p>It finished the day 13th out of 20 products with 67 upvotes. </p><p>Not bad for a 3 day project.</p><p>More importantly, I learned a couple things about Product Hunt and I wanted to share:</p><ol><li>60 Character Pitch</li><li>Voter Turnout</li><li>Be Consistent</li></ol><h2 id=\"60-character-pitch\">60 Character Pitch</h2><p>The most important asset you'll need for Product Hunt is a tagline - your 60 character pitch.</p><p>Yes, the thumbnail can steal the show, but Product Hunt is a battle of taglines.</p><p>Let’s break down a Product Hunt Launch widget:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nLASNG57SeZRsI4uy5wJHvEtSzRcoa5aVSWjTtIVZ0VguWgx2cdxhDbwT1o2ISRRbCakG1VHisc55rvnJ7J4g2v_yuEf6deslKSV6ZwrPYKWbnMX3cBVL5Ms9paqi4LXAWRCkRDK\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>There are six things here:</p><ol><li>Thumbnail</li><li>Title</li><li>Tagline</li><li>Categories</li><li>Comment count</li><li>Upvote count</li></ol><p>And you can control 4:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/VQpKoDiM_EzWU0Dz2tsK-tFqPGZeoIidZN17eBBpZIDdyTR66BpKdPJh0ZUjhr_H5r72ke9TrELe4EeipHoplG_4QAJKVLPJpbS_MWT5sult9iRMkmKr0MwzcRGSb1wo6DbbdLb_\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><br><br>There’s a good chance you’ve already chosen a name (a url is required for submission), and the categories leave little room for creativity. Thus, you’re left to experiment with the thumbnail and the tagline.</p><p>I’m no master of the thumbnail, but I have a tip for the tagline.</p><p>With the constrained real estate, there’s only space to convey your <em>differentiated</em> value. What makes your product pop?</p><p>To jumpstart your brainstorm, here are products with taglines that rock:</p><ul><li>Superhuman - The fastest email experience ever made</li><li>Good Eggs - Absurdly fresh groceries, delivered</li><li>Yellowtail Wines - Great tasting, quality wines for everyone to enjoy</li><li>DuckDuckGo - The search engine that doesn’t track you (informal tagline)</li></ul><p>Notice how they all differentiate themselves:</p><ul><li>Superhuman is <strong>faster</strong> ⚡️</li><li>Good Eggs is <strong>fresher</strong> 🥬</li><li>Yellowtail Wines is <strong>more approachable</strong> 👋</li><li>DuckDuckGo is <strong>more private</strong> 😎</li></ul><p>When you launch, prepare your hard-hitting, differentiated 60 character pitch.</p><h2 id=\"voter-turnout\">Voter Turnout</h2><p>I just lied when I said you can only control 4 sections in your launch widget (sorry!). The upvote count is actually a bit more in your control than you might think.</p><p>Product Hunt’s launch guide (<a href=\"https://blog.producthunt.com/how-to-launch-on-product-hunt-7c1843e06399\">here</a>) encourages you to reach out to friends on Facebook and followers on Twitter. They discourage asking for upvotes, but encourage organic, authentic sharing.</p><p>For Emoji cp, I made a Twitter post, which 3 friends presumably saw, as they upvoted Emoji cp within an hour. I can’t tell if they enjoyed the product, or if they were showing their support (or both), but their upvotes made a difference! (Thanks guys ❤️)</p><p>In the first hour of launch, products jostle for position. In a hierarchical game like Product Hunt, products at the top accrue advantages. This is for a couple reasons:</p><ol><li><strong>Traffic</strong> - many people never scroll past the 5th product. Furthermore, products in the bottom half are hidden behind a “load more” button. Thus, products at the top receive an unfair amount of traffic compared to products at the bottom. Assuming your widget converts at a fixed percentage: More traffic (🚦) = More upvotes (⬆️).</li><li><strong>Influence</strong> - when a product has a lot of upvotes, it influences others to give it more of a chance. Some people will upvote only once there are sufficient upvotes. (Subconsciously, I'm kind of like this). So really, More upvotes = Better conversion! The power of the herd is strong 🐮</li></ol><p>Early upvotes from friends and followers give you an early boost in the rankings. And then, the benefits of increased <strong>traffic</strong> and <strong>influence</strong> start working for you, not against you.</p><p>Voter turnout matters - get your constituency behind you.</p><p><em>Btw, if you’re launching a product on Product Hunt, make sure you let me know. Knowing what I now know, I'll help you out! </em></p><h2 id=\"be-consistent\">Be Consistent</h2><p>Emoji cp’s Product Hunt launch had one big problem.</p><p>The tagline on the website and the tagline on Product Hunt were different.</p><ul><li>Website: Search for emoji. Click (or press Enter) to copy</li><li>ProductHunt: Find and copy emoji, fast</li></ul><p>If customers like your product, they’ll want to tell their friends. When they do that, they’ll use some variation of your tagline. If you have multiple taglines, customers need to decide which one to use - <strong>IF</strong> they can even remember any of them.</p><p>Have one way of talking about your product. Use it as your Product Hunt tagline. Put it on your website. Use it in your tweets. Be consistent.</p><p><em>Caveat: you want to avoid semantic satiation. So on the same page, do not use the tagline 25 times. Rather, the idea here is to keep a consistent tagline across <strong>distinct</strong> impressions.</em></p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>A successful Product Hunt launch can accelerate your product's adoption by weeks - and it's useful to get it right. Emoji cp was a fun side project of mine, so I didn't take it as seriously as others on Product Hunt do. That said, I learned some serious lessons:</p><ol><li><strong>60 Character Pitch</strong> - differentiate yourself with a value-dense tagline</li><li><strong>Voter Turnout</strong> - Upvotes beget more upvotes, so get your people out to the polls</li><li><strong>Be Consistent</strong> - Make it easier for word of mouth to take off and be consistent with your language</li></ol><p>Finally, it's important to note that Product Hunt’s greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. Product Hunt drives traffic to you. It’s good at answering the question: “Do a lot of people like this product at least a little bit?”. It does not really give you an answer for the more important question: “Does anyone love this product?”.</p><p>For true insights, you need to listen to your fans. The comments section on Product Hunt is helpful (I received two roadmap suggestions that hinted at where Emoji cp should go), but you’ll need to dig for insights.</p><p>Funny enough, the most important piece of customer feedback I received wasn’t on Product Hunt at all!

For the last 3 months, I had been traveling solo in Asia. After being laid off from my last company, a solo trip was just what the doctor ordered.</p><p>While I was away, one of my roommates, Richard (not his real name), quit his job and moved into full-time job search mode. Richard is also a software engineer and failed 3 Technical Phone Screens and 5 onsites before his first offer. That’s 8 “No’s” before the first “Yes”. After accumulating those scars, he was a battle-tested vet. Richard became my sherpa.</p><p>Here’s the advice he gave me:</p><ul><li>Get ready for lots of BFS/DFS problems. Some good ones: <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands\">https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands</a> , <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island\">https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island</a> , <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/problems/minesweeper\">https://leetcode.com/problems/minesweeper</a></li><li>For some reason, the LRU cache problem comes up a lot.

But definitely prepare before you take the TripleByte quiz. (Triplebyte is how Richard found his first job a couple years back)</li></ul><p>The knowledge that Richard had gone through his own struggles before landing at Google was comforting. With that, I began the first steps of the job search: Identifying Opportunities, Networking and Resume Polishing.</p><h2 id=\"identifying-opportunities\">Identifying Opportunities</h2><p>I started with a list of companies that interested me. These were companies that I was impressed by from a distance, either through blog posts (often authored by the company themselves), podcasts, or from people in my network. AngelList puts out curated lists of companies they call “<a href=\"https://angel.co/job-collections\">job collections</a>” which I drew upon for inspiration. I referenced the <a href=\"https://breakoutlist.com/\">Breakout List</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.wealthfront.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018_Career-Launching_List-10.pdf\">Wealthfront’s List of Career Launching companies</a>, although those sources are sparse on useful information. Next, I glanced at the list of portfolio companies at some well known VCs. From these mostly nebulous sources, I made three lists: Low-Mid Interest, Mid-High Interest and Crypto companies. Finally, I used Glassdoor reviews to sanity check if any of the companies on my list had red flags.</p><p>I wouldn’t discover <a href=\"https://www.keyvalues.com/\">Key Values</a> until week 4 of my process, but I wish I found it earlier. Key Values is a website that helps engineers find teams that share their cultural values. The profiles on Key Values are the closest thing to a company’s culture resume anywhere on the internet. Two reasons why I wish I knew about Key Values in week 1:</p><ol><li>It would have pushed me to think about culture even more. Up until this point, I had been evaluating companies based on three things: chance of financial success, mission alignment (did I care about the product?), and perceived operational efficiency.</li><li>I would have found more companies (By week 4, I was mostly executing off of the lists I formed in weeks 1 and 2)</li></ol><p>More on Key Values in the Appendix! But for now, just make sure to leverage Key Values early.</p><h2 id=\"networking\">Networking</h2><p>While I was traveling, I received an email from a recruiter at Greylock who connects engineers with Greylock’s portfolio companies. I couldn’t meet then, but when I returned, I bumped the thread and set up a time to chat. This relationship would ultimately prove quite fruitful and I encourage you to establish an open communication channel with recruiters at VCs. They’re wonderful people – and everybody loves a good matchmaker.</p><p>Additionally, I started reaching out to friends who worked at companies that were on my lists. This was admittedly not a very expansive network, and I only knew people who worked at 3 companies on my initial list: Affirm, PagerDuty and Uber. I asked if they would feel comfortable referring me and all three were happy to help.</p><p>Similarly, I reached out to friends and asked if they could introduce me to second degree connections. Often, I found that my friends were excited to make introductions if they could. Richard connected me to one of his good friends who worked at BitGo. Another one of my friends couldn’t introduce me to anyone, but he dogmatically encouraged me to apply to his company: Coffee Meets Bagel (CMB). While I didn’t get past the recruiter screen at CMB, his referral proved to be highly useful for our next topic: Resume polishing.</p><h2 id=\"resumes\">Resumes</h2><p>Keep resumes short. I have been part of the resume filtration process before and believe long resumes are a disservice to those who must read them. Respect other people’s time!</p><p>You can see <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wHtmSZ4JgV3WiZtjv5uyxc0z6qOtIVVM/view?usp=sharing\">the resume I used for my job search here</a>.</p><p>In one evening, I summed up my 3 years of professional experience into 4 or 5 bullet points. On another evening, I wrote descriptions for recent hackathon projects.</p><p>I sent my resume out for comments. Unsurprisingly, those who gave me the best comments were friends referring me to their own companies. My friend at CMB helped me eliminate vague bullet points. My friend at Uber gave me tactical advice: “Don’t list a technology on your resume unless you’re willing to be grilled on it”. So true. Don’t give your interviewer a chance to put you on the spot.</p><p>Next, I copied the updates from my resume into LinkedIn. And I marked that I was no longer at my previous job (it had been recommended to me to initially show that I was still at my previous company following the layoff, but it was time to rip off that band-aid).</p><p>My mindset for updating my resume was MVP. Honestly, resumes only serve two purposes:</p><ul><li>Get you noticed by recruiters for the job you want</li><li>A conversation starter for every interview</li></ul><p>Does your resume perform those two jobs? Great. Is it as simple as possible? Great. Now ship it. There are more important things to focus on. If you want any resume help, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pliao39\">connect with me</a>!</p><p>And finally, I got a friend to take a new photo of me (via my iPhone). I’ve started using it everywhere, on my <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pliao39\">LinkedIn</a>, on my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pliao39\">Twitter</a> and on this website. (PS If anyone out there knows someone who shoots great headshots, hit me up, I’m on the market for a new one)</p><h2 id=\"fortune-favors\">Fortune Favors</h2><p>…the unprepared? On January 30, I had been back for 6 jetlagged days. On that day, I was scouring the net for the answer this question: If I failed the Triplebyte quiz, could I try again? (The answer appears to be<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6y4ekx/can_i_retake_the_triplebyte_quiz/?st=jgbdyg8r&amp;sh=d5a5d321\"> yes, but after 4 months</a>). But suddenly, I felt a compulsion to ignore Richard’s advice and jump into the quiz – preparation be damned. My heart rate rose. I gazed at the start button. <em>Click</em></p><p>It was on.</p><p>The first 3 or so questions surprised me – I couldn’t answer them! Had to select “I don’t know”. I felt twinges of panic. And regret. Should have prepared! How is this quiz so hard! But the first punch in the face turned out to be the worst. I answered one question with confidence and then another. Each one calming my nerves. Eventually, I got on a roll.</p><p>Later (I don’t remember when), I got an Intercom message on Triplebyte’s site: “Congrats on doing very well on the quiz! The next step is a technical interview with us.”</p><p>Wow, okay. Hurdle cleared.</p><h1 id=\"weeks-3-6-the-grind\">Weeks 3-6: The Grind</h1><h2 id=\"pep-talk\">Pep Talk</h2><p>The job search process can completely shake your self confidence. You know what you’re capable of. You know what you’ve done in the past. In fact, no one in the world knows your ability better than you do (although <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/03/you-dont-know-yourself-as-well-as-you-think-you-do/554612/\">collectively, your co-workers probably do</a>, but that’s collectively). Yet, here you are, being evaluated and tested. All of your past accomplishments are invalidated.</p><p>This sucks. Doing something you haven’t done in a long time (interviewing) and getting judged on your ability to do that thing can mess with your head.</p><p>You might start avoiding companies that you suspect will reject you (this is what I was subconsciously doing at first). You might lose motivation, stop studying and cease applying altogether. You might be led to feel incompetent, unintelligent and unemployable.</p><p>One of my friends texted me: “How do you stay positive?”</p><p>Me: “I don’t haha”</p><p>In response to this feeling, I started to question the usefulness of interviews and their ability to detect my value. For a while, I stopped preparing for interviews and pursued other interests (for me, I studied other things: <a href=\"https://cryptozombies.io/\">CryptoZombies</a> and <a href=\"https://hpbn.co/\">High Performance Browser Networking</a>, both of which are great resources, btw. Of course, I procrastinated with the usual suspects as well: watching sports, reading random articles on the internet).</p><p>Many smart people have abandoned the idea of getting a traditional job and have sidestepped the interview process altogether by starting their own companies. In one of his recent <a href=\"https://steveblank.com/2018/04/11/why-entrepreneurs-start-companies-rather-than-join-them/\">blog posts</a>, Steve Blank analyzes the paper <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2596846\">Asymmetric Information and Entrepreneurship</a> and summarizes one of its conclusions:</p><p>“People choose to be entrepreneurs when they feel that they are more capable than what employers can tell from their resume or an interview. So, entrepreneurs start ventures because they can’t signal their worth to potential employers.”</p><p>I began to feel that way. And on top of that, I met up with a few friends who had struck out on their own and started businesses: <a href=\"http://vietcetera.com/\">Vietcetera</a> and <a href=\"https://originofmind.clothing/\">Origin of Mind</a>. With Vietcetera, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/haontran\">Hao</a> is spotlighting an emerging Vietnam, with a focus on culture and business. The vibe is a bit like The New Yorker, but more entrepreneurial and a whole lot more Vietnamese. With Origin of Mind, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alalafox\">Alex</a> is using clothing to spark conversation on some of the country’s most important social issues. She launched in Oakland with the “On Education” collection.</p><p>I began to wonder if I should follow in their steps and do something of my own.</p><p>But at the end of the day, I focused on my long game. Yes, my present situation sucks. Yes, this process is uncomfortable. Yes, there might be very intelligent ways to forgo it entirely. But what are my long term goals? What kind of opportunities do I want to be looking at in 10 years time?</p><p>My long term goals are nebulous. I know it has something to do with community building, entrepreneurship and technology. Only, the shape hasn’t crystallized yet. And thus, I decided to invest in education. I determined that I would be able to learn the most by working with people who possessed managerial, technical and entrepreneurial skills that I lacked. (And hustling on the side – but, that’s always).</p><p>But perhaps most significantly, I simply felt this had to be done. The job hunt was something I had been fearful of and as I learned in a meditation class: “What we need to do is often what we fear the most” (Tim Ferris also has <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/314018-what-we-fear-doing-most-is-usually-what-we-most\">a variation</a> of this saying). I can be extremely stubborn.</p><p>There are no right answers. Everyone is at a different place and has a different destination in mind. But if your conclusion, like mine, is to continue with your job search, read on, I’ll drop a few tips on how to get through the grind of getting to onsite interviews.</p><h2 id=\"use-a-scheduling-tool\">Use a Scheduling Tool</h2><p>You may waste a lot of time scheduling. Solve the nightmare of double bookings (when two companies book the same time), excessive back and forths, and large blocks of wasted time with a tool like <a href=\"https://calendly.com\">Calendly</a> or <a href=\"https://youcanbook.me\">You Can Book Me</a>. I’ve seen people use <a href=\"https://mixmax.com\">Mixmax</a>, which directly allows people to book a time within an email. They’re all great tools, and any of them will do. If you find yourself thinking too much about scheduling, use a scheduling tool.</p><h2 id=\"connect-with-decision-makers\">Connect with Decision Makers</h2><p>When you can, connect with decision makers. If the CTO reaches out, take the call 100% of the time. If you’re going to reach out to a company, ask for introductions to decision makers. I find that conversations with decision makers are much more invigorating. Instead of sizing you up, wondering if you will pass their technical challenges, decision makers are thinking about fit. They spend the phone call trying to probe if you’ll be excellent on their team. This will be a great way to break up the monotony of talking to recruiters. (And anecdotally, converts much better too!)</p><p>In fact, I believe there is a way to conduct a job search that revolves entirely around connecting with decision makers – instead of a numbers game, it’s all about developing mutual trust with a small number of people who are looking to stack their teams with absurdly strong talent. But, that’s an entirely different approach from the one I conducted and a discussion for a different time.</p><h2 id=\"my-screens\">My Screens</h2><p>For me, weeks 3 – 6 were dominated by phone screens and take homes. This section of my job search was a grind. I spent a large percentage of my time waiting for phone calls. I tried to utilize that time to study, but was very inefficient. Nonetheless, I did the bulk of my studying during these weeks. On some days I did one or two Leetcode problems (it’s okay if you fail lots of questions and need to look at the answer after 25 minutes. I did this a lot. Just try to find a similar question and use what you learned). On other days, I worked on problems from Cracking the Coding Interview. On other days, I read sections from the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Eastern-Economy-Thomas/dp/8120340078/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1524621154&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=clrs+algorithms\">CLRS Algorithms book</a>.</p><p>For some reason, interviewers love to ask questions that involve BFS/DFS (as Richard foretold), tree traversals, and 2 pointer problems. The last category is nebulous, but is a very useful tool in your toolbox. It involves using two (or more) pointers in crafty ways (maybe you have one pointer start at the beginning of a sorted array and another at the end, maybe you have two sorted lists and use a pointer for each…). If you have identified a brute force solution that requires O(n^2) comparisons, this is often a fruitful question: “Can I do better if I use two pointers to get everything done in O(n) time?”. This was a surprisingly helpful tactic for me.</p><p>Another note – I loved take homes. As a practicing software engineer, I found that take home assignments gave me a chance to send a true signal about my abilities. They weren’t algorithm heavy, but tested my ability to write non trivial, production-level code. Affirm provided the option of either a take home or a technical phone screen. I gladly took the take home – not only did I get a chance to write code that simulated real work, I learned some useful domain knowledge that helped me understand their business.</p><p>During this grind, I also experienced rejection. At the recruiter screen, I was rejected by Crew and CMB. At the technical phone screen, I was rejected by Pinterest and Blend. Blend in particular hurt, I had gotten excited about the idea that Blend would be a good fit. But as Richard advised me at the very beginning, get used to rejection.</p><p>Believe it or not, rejection is a good thing. It means you have pushed yourself to your current boundaries. Furthermore, it toughens you for future encounters, improving your ability to stay calm under pressure. Getting rejected by Pinterest and Blend also made me a little better at technical questions (I implemented improved solutions to the problems immediately after the screens).</p><p>But don’t worry, the rejections didn’t stop there.</p><h1 id=\"weeks-7-10-onsites-and-offers\">Weeks 7-10: Onsites and Offers</h1><h2 id=\"week-7\">Week 7</h2><p>Some of my phone screens and take homes started to convert and suddenly, it was onsite season. My first two onsites were with Sonder and Google. I failed both. Interestingly, they were polar opposites. Sonder asked 0 algorithm questions, focusing entirely on system design and object oriented programming. Googled asked 5 algorithm/cleverness questions. I was completely stumped by one of the questions and spent most of the 45 minute session trying to keep a level head. I walked out of the interview embarrassed. I refer to this interview as The Disaster. (The other 4 were ok).</p><p>I went home to Texas for 5 days (Thursday through Monday) after my Google interview. Taking a planned vacation in the middle of onsite season was incredibly important. It gave me a chance to integrate the lessons of failure, as well as a chance to relax and get ready for the next wave of onsites. I highly recommend a period of rest if you can make it happen.</p><h2 id=\"week-8\">Week 8</h2><p>The following week, I had onsites with Intercom, b8ta and Solv. With the scars from my recent failures, I walked into those onsites with confidence. At both b8ta and Solv, one of my interviews centered around CSS, which I bombed. But unlike The Disaster at Google, I did not panic, not even a little. I stayed calm, openly told my interviewers that CSS was the weakest of my full stack skills and we proceeded to have a surprisingly not-awkward session of me DuckDuckGo-ing basic CSS. I was rejected by b8ta and Solv. In their email to me, Solv told me this: “While everyone appreciated your personality, communication and problem solving, tech thinking, we hit a road block on the core front end skills..” Haha, fair enough!</p><p>On Friday, Intercom called me to let me know they were extending an offer! Everything changes when you get your first offer. Your belief in yourself is finally re-validated. Just as importantly, other companies will pick up the pace and get with your timeline.</p><h2 id=\"week-9\">Week 9</h2><p>The next week, I had onsites with Earnin, Affirm and Uber. At this point, the onsites felt routine. Once in a while, I felt that my interviewers were really testing me, pushing the envelope to see how I would react. I clearly communicated what I completely didn’t know and stretched to hit the questions I thought I could get.</p><p>Earnin and Uber extended offers. Affirm would not get back to me until the following week with a soft rejection: the team I had interviewed with would not be moving forward, but they could reconsider me for a different team. I accepted the rejection and declined to move forward with the other team.</p><p>As an aside, the length of time a company takes to get back to you after the onsite is incredibly revealing. If it’s in 1 or 2 days, the result was either a clear yes or clear no. This is ideal. If it’s longer than 3 days, then the result was either contentious or the company doesn’t operate efficiently. Neither of those are good things. You want to go to a team that wants you, not a team that is settling for you. And you definitely don’t want to go to team that doesn’t respect candidates’ time.</p><h2 id=\"week-10\">Week 10</h2><p>In my final week, I managed to squeeze in one last company into the mix. I had alluded to BitGo earlier in my blog post, but what I did not share was that I had actually designed my entire interview process with them in mind. I shared this with Richard one day. I had been reading High Performance Browser Networking and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Belshe\">Mike Belshe</a>, the CEO of BitGo, kept popping up in the book. While at Google, he had masterminded the SPDY specification which laid the foundation for HTTP 2.0. I had been reading some Bitcoin blogs and <a href=\"https://lopp.net/\">Jameson Lopp</a>, a BitGo engineer, kept popping up. (Jameson has since left, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lopp/status/969567040401965056\">but on great terms</a>). I wanted to be in the Crypto space and BitGo was the one company I really had strong interest in joining.</p><p>Richard had a good friend at BitGo who referred me. The company sent me a HackerRank coding challenge. I did it (although one of my solutions didn’t pass all tests). I didn’t hear back for a while, assuming that I had been screened out. Then, out of the blue, I got a message from BitGo in week 9 – they wanted to set up a technical phone screen. We squeezed in the phone screen on Friday of week 9 and my onsite was on Monday of week 10.</p><p>I thought the BitGo onsite was solid, despite it being my 7th onsite in 13 days. My solutions weren’t as sharp as they could have been, but they weren’t bad. In my tired state, I tried to communicate my strong interest in BitGo. They asked for references and I waited for them to check in with some of my former coworkers. 4 days later, I got a call from BitGo letting me know that they would not be matching my other offers and would not extend one of their own.</p><p>I’ve heard this time and time again. The more you want to work at a company, the more desperate you come off, and the less desirable of a candidate you become. This is by no means a deal breaker for companies, but you should avoid doing what I did. Don’t design your process around one company. The chances are, they won’t reciprocate and might even read your enthusiasm as uncomfortable desperation. Just keep an open mind, your best opportunity might not even be one you were hoping to get. It’s sort of like Frank Ocean said/sang: “The best song wasn’t the single”.</p><p>On a related note, an hour after I heard back from BitGo, I spoke with a Director of Engineering at Uber (my manager’s manager). I was sold. On March 30, 2018 at 2PM I contacted Intercom, Earnin and Uber and communicated my decision. It had been 65 days since I touched down in SFO. The job search had finally ended. I was Uber bound.</p><h1 id=\"lessons\">Lessons</h1><p>I had a few takeaways from my job search.</p><ul><li><strong>Act</strong> before you feel ready</li><li>Do you feel 40% ready? Great! You’re more than ready to get out there</li><li>Always be <strong>networking</strong></li><li>Even when you’re job searching, form new connections! But never ask new connections for help. Always have the mentality of being a valuable addition to people’s network.</li><li>Leverage your close connections for introductions to companies</li><li>Ask your close connections for referrals (there’s usually a referral bonus anyways)</li><li>Respect other people’s <strong>time</strong> (but especially, your own!)</li><li>Concise resumes</li><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@Torbahax/how-to-write-emails-like-a-ceo-d6a2906611e0\">Concise emails</a></li><li>Use a scheduler (like Calendly, You Can Book Me, Mixmax or some competitor)</li><li>Study in <strong>manageable</strong> <strong>bits</strong></li><li>Spend 25 minutes on a problem and if you’re going nowhere, peek at the solution</li><li>Don’t try to cram multiple topics in a day. For example, I took one evening to understand min/max heaps. Nothing more. It was one of my most productive study sessions.</li><li>Don’t get tunnel vision. Have a mentality of <strong>abundance</strong></li><li>“The best song wasn’t the single”</li><li>Tons of excellent companies out there. If you get rejected from one that you particularly like, don’t sweat it. There will be more. Always.</li><li>Embrace <strong>failure</strong></li><li>Failure sucks! But each failure is an asset. It’s like fertilizer for growth. So long as you are putting in effort, failure will accelerate your progress like nothing else. Getting used to it will give you an edge</li><li><strong>Being laid off doesn’t matter</strong></li><li>The pain from being laid off will heal with time and as you talk more openly about it.</li><li>While it might be a sore topic for you, most people will not prod. They might be curious as to what happened, but a simple tautology or circular definition is almost always enough to appease their curiosity: “The company didn’t meet its financial aspirations and elected to downsize. I was affected”</li><li>Let me know if you want to talk more about it</li></ul><p>It’s going to suck! Putting yourself out there for assessment and evaluation is a vulnerable experience. It’s not pleasant. And if you’re like me, you probably won’t enjoy it. But deep down, you’ll know whether or not this process is something you must do. For me, I felt that I had to do this. I felt compelled to push through.</p><p>And if you ever need someone to rely on, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pliao39\">come find me</a>. So long as I’m not inundated with projects, I will make time for you. I believe we all need a strong support network in difficult times and I’d be thrilled to become a node in your network!</p><hr><h1 id=\"appendix-recommended-companies\">Appendix: Recommended Companies</h1><p>In my job search, I applied to 18 companies and talked with 13. There lots of great things to say about each, but I want to highlight a few that I’m extra excited about. These are companies that I would strongly recommend to friends.</p><h2 id=\"intercom\"><a href=\"https://www.intercom.com/careers\">Intercom</a></h2><p>I’m really excited about Intercom both as a business and as a place to work. Intercom’s engineering values of “<a href=\"https://blog.intercom.com/run-less-software\">Run less software</a>” and “<a href=\"https://blog.intercom.com/shipping-is-your-companys-heartbeat/\">Shipping is your company’s heartbeat</a>” really resonated with me. As someone who has been heavily influenced by the book <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em>, Intercom’s engineering culture felt incredibly efficient. Jamming with the team on a hackathon-like project was energizing and fun. The team is entrepreneurial and pragmatic.</p><p>For anyone who loves building excellent product, I would strongly advise Intercom.</p><h2 id=\"solv\"><a href=\"https://www.solvhealth.com/careers\">Solv</a></h2><p>My phone call with Daniele (CTO and co-founder at Solv) was one of the highlights of my job search. We talked about life, healthcare, Bill Gurley, prioritization and my work style. I left the call feeling incredibly excited. The onsite with Solv was great, but unfortunately, my CSS deficiencies were a deal breaker.</p><p>If you’re interested in healthcare, like working with smart and passionate people, then you have to check out Solv. (You should also read the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Catastrophic-Care-Everything-Think-Health/dp/034580273X\">Catastrophic Care</a>)</p><h2 id=\"earnin\"><a href=\"https://www.earnin.com/Careers\">Earnin</a></h2><p>When I went onsite at Earnin, I was impressed with their engineering culture. Interviews felt collaborative, the assessments were diverse (system design, algorithm, short answer, object oriented design), and the people were down to earth. The more junior engineers talked about how they felt supported by the senior engineers, and the more senior engineers mentioned how they liked mentoring. This all happened without any top down directives with regards to mentoring.</p><p>If you’re looking for a strong group of engineers who have built a great organic culture, I believe you’ll find it at Earnin.</p><h2 id=\"triplebyte\"><a href=\"https://triplebyte.com\">Triplebyte</a></h2><p>Ok, so I didn’t interview for a position at Triplebyte, but I worked with them. Of all my 44 technical assessments, the Triplebyte interview was the most fun and engaging. My talent manager was enthusiastic and genuinely wanted to place me at a great company. The only thing about Triplebyte that is a bit hit or miss is their matching process (a bit opaque and not always successful). Still, it is absolutely worth your time to work with Triplebyte.</p><p>As an aside, I would have paid just to take their assessment and “get Triplebyte certified”. That would be a nice feature for those with non-traditional backgrounds to signal that they’ve been vetted by at least one 3rd party.</p><p>Try out their <a href=\"https://quiz.triplebyte.com/\">practice quiz</a> – it’s actually kind of hard (I learned a couple things even from this practice quiz!). Read their <a href=\"https://triplebyte.com/blog\">blog</a>. It’s excellent. And if you’re curious about salaries, check out their <a href=\"https://triplebyte.com/software-engineer-salary\">aggregated salary visualizations</a>. I don’t talk about salary in this post, but I will comment that those graphs were in line with my offers.</p><h1 id=\"appendix-critical-resources\">Appendix: Critical Resources</h1><h2 id=\"key-values\"><a href=\"https://www.keyvalues.com/\">Key Values</a></h2><p>I mentioned it earlier, but I want to reiterate – Key Values is the closest thing to a company’s culture resume anywhere on the internet. Companies get to talk about what they think is important and highlight their cultural strengths.</p><p>Additionally, browsing Key Values will reaffirm your beliefs in your own cultural values. This is incredibly important to be thinking about throughout your job search. While Key Values may not have the company profile that you’re looking for, it will categorically make your job search better.</p><p>Do yourself a favor and use Key Values from the start. And check out the <a href=\"https://www.keyvalues.com/culture-queries\">culture queries</a>, it will get your mind thinking about the important things.</p><h2 id=\"angellist\"><a href=\"https://angel.co/\">AngelList</a></h2><p>AngelList is a fantastic resource to get in contact with startups. I know so many people who have gotten jobs through AngelList, and in fact, it was how I got my first job. One thing to be aware of is that on AngelList, a company can see the number of companies a candidate has indicated interest in. Don’t be the person who is “interested” in 723 companies. Be selective.</p><h2 id=\"glassdoor\"><a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/index.htm\">Glassdoor</a></h2><p>Let it be known that I believe Glassdoor is the Yelp of company culture reviews. It’s heavily influenced by disgruntled employees and coordinated manipulation (I stumbled upon a well known company with over 40 reviews, the majority of which were generic 5 star reviews published within a 7 day span). The product is occasionally unusable (because they constantly direct you to use their job search product). But it has some great authentic reviews. And it’s not going anywhere because of its strong network effects. Ultimately, those brief moments of authenticity are worth the noise.</p><p>I love and hate Glassdoor.</p>","comment_id":"5dff0c578e30f03d2f93df88","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1499750310107-5fef28a66643?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":false,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":false,"created_at":"2019-12-22T06:25:27.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-10-13T20:28:36.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-04-24T06:38:00.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"The story of how I landed at Uber.
